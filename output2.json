            "body": "The Manmohan Singh government indicated on Tuesday that the cap on the subsidised LPG cylinders would go up from six to nine a household a year.\n\u201cI think it is likely to go up definitely from six to nine cylinders, and the Cabinet [Committee on Political Affairs] will have to grant its approval to the proposal,\u201d Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Veerappa Moily told journalists at a function here on Tuesday.\nA large number of Congress MPs had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, demanding that the cap be raised to 12 cylinders. On September 13, the government decided to limit the cylinder supply to six, while allowing the consumers to buy additional cylinders at the market price of Rs. 931 a 14.2-kg bottle. Subsidised LPG costs Rs. 410.50 a cylinder in New Delhi. Mr. Moily said he had held two rounds of consultations with Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on the impact of a decision to raise the cap. \u201cI think a decision could happen as early as possible,\u201d he said. The concession would entail Rs. 9,000 crore in additional subsidy a year on the government. \u201cWe are working on ways of mitigating the additional subsidy requirement. We are working on certain formula to neutralise it.\u201d\nAsked whether the government would make the announcement shortly or wait for the Assembly elections in Gujarat to conclude, Mr. Moily said a decision would be taken before the election process ended and the government would not approach the Election Commission.\nSources said raising the cap would mean that the Finance Ministry would have to shell out Rs. 3,000 crore in additional subsidy this fiscal.\nHowever, Petroleum Ministry officials said the Finance Ministry had not conveyed its approval of the scheme yet. \u201cThe matter is still under discussion with the Finance Ministry, and there has been no commitment. There is no formal approval for the enhanced cap and we will have to wait for the final nod from the Finance Ministry,\u2019\u2019 a senior official remarked.\n"

Vahanvati and asked him to render assistance to decide on this important question of law.\nA Bench of Justices R.M. Lodha and Anil R. Dave also asked senior counsel Gopal Subramanium and M.N. Krishnamani, who were present in the court, to give their valuable suggestions in deciding the case.\nThe question involved in the case is whether the oath taken by the appellant, Umesh Challiyil, then a member of the Kerala Assembly, in the name of Sree Narayana Guru, whom he considers and believes as God, under Article 188 of the Constitution was liable to be declared invalid on the ground that it was not in the form prescribed in the third schedule of the Constitution.\n\nHigh Court verdict\n\nMr. Challiyil of the Janadhipathya Samrakshana Samiti was sworn in as Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in 2001 in the name of the Guru on his winning the election from Kodungalloor. The Kerala High Court, acting on a writ petition filed by Haridas from Kozhikode, held that the oath \u201cdoes not conform to the constitutional mandate, since the form prescribes the oath to be taken in the name of God or solemnly affirmed, whereas he took oath in the name of Sree Narayana Guru.\u201d\nAssailing the verdict, Mr. Challiyil said \u201cthe High Court went wrong in not considering the real purpose of mandate under Article 188 of the Constitution, that the member of the State Legislature should take pledge that he will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution and also uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, and as a guarantee for this, he should take oath in the name of God.\nTherefore, there is nothing wrong if he takes oath in the name of Sree Narayana Guru whom he considers and believes as God.\u201d\n\nArticle 188\n\nHe said the High Court also went wrong in holding that the oath should be taken exactly in the form given in the third schedule.\nArticle 188 says: \u201cEvery member of the Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council of a State shall, before taking his seat, make and subscribe before the Governor, or some person appointed in that behalf by him, an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the third schedule.\u201d\nThe form of oath provided under the third schedule for the member of the State Legislature reads: \u201cI, A.B., having been elected (or nominated) a member of the Legislative Assembly (or Legislative Council), do swear in the name of God/ solemnly affirm that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India and that I will faithfully discharge the duty upon which I am about to enter.\u2019\u2019\nThe appellant said \u201cit is seen that the mandate under Article 188 is to take oath in accordance with the form and therefore there is nothing wrong in naming the God or using the name of the Guru, whom he considers as God. If the form set out in the third schedule is substantially followed, it has to be treated as it is in accordance with the prescribed form and the contrary view taken by the High Court is unsustainable.\u201d\nHe sought a direction to quash the impugned judgment.\nThe Bench directed that the matter be listed for further hearing on February 6, 2013.\n"

Dr. Bilham was deported back to the U.S. from the New Delhi airport soon after landing on May 19 around midnight when he was on transit to Bhutan.\nAt that time, Dr. Bilham was apparently told by the customs authorities that his name was on a certain list of persons denied entry into India and was given no other reason. \u201cThe State Department,\u201d Dr. Bilham has claimed, \u201chas twice been informed that I am on a list of foreigners not allowed to visit India.\nThe list includes terrorists and journalists and one other scientist. This one other scientist wrote about voting machine insecurity in India.\u201d The State Department has, however, not been told why his name is on the list.\nDr. Bilham is well-known for his extensive work on Himalayan seismicity, much of it carried out with a reputed Indian geophysicist, Dr. Vinod Gaur, the former director of the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), Hyderabad. In January of this year, he addressed a press conference by Greenpeace on the potential seismic risk to the proposed 9900 MWe nuclear power plant complex at Jaitapur, Maharashtra.\nChallenging the version given by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) at the time of his deportation, Dr. Bilham has revealed new information through email exchanges after the story of his deportation, which was hitherto not widely known (see, however, The Hindu, August 12 and Sunday Guardian, May 27), hit the international headlines through a December 6 report in the journal Science.\nThe Science story, quoting the MHA, said that Dr. Bilham was denied entry because, while travelling on tourist visa, his \u201cactivity\u201d was \u201cnot commensurate with the type of visa granted\u201d. Dr. Bilham, who has a multiple-entry ten-year tourist visa and has made several visits to India since the 1960s, has, however, stated that the barring of his entry had nothing to do with any visa problem. \u201cMy visa has not been revoked. It has not been cancelled. No mention of a visa problem has ever been made,\u201d Dr. Bilham stated in his email. \u201cMy flight to Bhutan was the next day. I planned to stay overnight in Delhi.\u201d\nThe report in Science followed the issue having been raised at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) during December 3-7 in San Francisco. Dr. Max Wyss, director of the World Agency of Planetary Monitoring and Earthquake Risk Reduction, Geneva, in his presentation had likened his deportation to the arrests of seismoligists in Italy, who have been painted as criminals following the L\u2019Aquila earthquake for having not provided the corr ect advice on the impending earthquake.\n\n(Continued on Page 12)\n"

Dr. Bilham was deported back to the U.S. from the New Delhi airport soon after landing on May 19 around midnight when he was on transit to Bhutan.\nAt that time, Dr. Bilham was apparently told by the customs authorities that his name was on a certain list of persons denied entry into India and was given no other reason. \u201cThe State Department,\u201d Dr. Bilham has claimed, \u201chas twice been informed that I am on a list of foreigners not allowed to visit India. The list includes terrorists and journalists and one other scientist. This one other scientist wrote about voting machine insecurity in India.\u201d The State Department has, however, not been told why his name is on the list.\nDr. Bilham is well-known for his extensive work on Himalayan seismicity, much of it carried out with a reputed Indian geophysicist, Dr. Vinod Gaur, the former director of the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), Hyderabad. In January of this year, he addressed a press conference by Greenpeace on the potential seismic risk to the proposed 9900 MWe nuclear power plant complex at Jaitapur, Maharashtra.\nChallenging the version given by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) at the time of his deportation, Dr. Bilham has revealed new information through email exchanges after the story of his deportation, which was hitherto not widely known (see, however, The Hindu, August 12 and Sunday Guardian, May 27), hit the international headlines through a December 6 report in the journal Science.\nThe Science story, quoting the MHA, said that Dr. Bilham was denied entry because, while travelling on tourist visa, his \u201cactivity\u201d was \u201cnot commensurate with the type of visa granted\u201d. Dr. Bilham, who has a multiple-entry ten-year tourist visa and has made several visits to India since the 1960s, has, however, stated that the barring of his entry had nothing to do with any visa problem. \u201cMy visa has not been revoked. It has not been cancelled. No mention of a visa problem has ever been made,\u201d Dr. Bilham stated in his email. \u201cMy flight to Bhutan was the next day. I planned to stay overnight in Delhi.\u201d\nDr. Bilham last visited India to attend the \u2018Indo-US Workshop on \u2018Intraplate Seismicity\u2019 held during January 16-18 at the Institute for Seismological Research (ISR), an institute under the department of science and technology (DST) in Gandhinagar, on an invitation extended to him. Even though he was on a tourist visa, he had been given explicit authorisation to not only attend the meeting but also to travel in the Kutch region by Dr. B. K. Rastogi, director, ISR. He returned on January 18.\nThe report in Science followed the issue having been raised at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) during December 3-7 in San Francisco. Dr. Max Wyss, director of the World Agency of Planetary Monitoring and Earthquake Risk Reduction, Geneva, in his presentation had likened his deportation to the arrests of seismoligists in Italy, who have been painted as criminals following the L\u2019Aquila earthquake for having not provided the correct advice on the impending earthquake.\n\n(Continued on Page 12)\n\n\nHe says he has twice been informed that he was on a list of foreigners not allowed to visit India\n\n\n\n\nThe list includes terrorists and journalists and one other scientist\n\n\n"

Large screens would boast scores of trees (250 or more) and reams of paper (over 2,00,000 sheets) were saved thanks to this \u201cpaperless\u201d meeting. But the Doha Climate Gateway is not going to save the world from the impacts of climate change, it has only managed to keep a tedious process of negotiations alive with a faint glimmer of hope.\nWhile most countries agreed to a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, the developed countries, led by the U.S., manoeuvred the world into adopting the Gateway with no commitment on their part to cut emissions or put money on the table. Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Russia walked away from the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, following the U.S.\n\nNew commitment period\n\nConf\u00e9rence of Parties (COP) 18 president Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah said the Doha Climate Gateway marked the beginning of discussions on a universal, legally-binding international agreement on emission reductions, which should be ratified in 2015 and should come into force in 2020. The organisers maintained that governments had taken the next essential step in the global response to climate change. Countries launched a new commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, agreed on a firm time table to adopt a universal climate agreement by 2015 and a path to raise ambition to respond to climate change.\nThey also endorsed the completion of new institutions and agreed upon ways and means to deliver scaled-up climate finance and technology to developing countries.\n\u201cDoha has opened up a new gateway to bigger ambition and to greater action,\u201d said Mr. Al-Attiyah. \nChristiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said: \u201cDoha is another step in the right direction, but we still have a long road ahead. The door to stay below two degrees remains barely open.\u201d She said the Doha agreement was a bridge between the original Kyoto Protocol, which was drawn up in 1997 and which expires at the end of this year, and the next protocol, which was agreed to in principle in Durban (the Durban platform) last year and is due to be signed in 2015. In Doha, she said, all countries had agreed to produce a document detailing their reduced carbon emissions six months in advance of the 2015 COP.\nThe climate talks were attended by 194 countries with 16,000 participants. The work that began in Bali in 2007 on the long-term cooperative action and extension to the Kyoto Protocol was concluded but real commitments were missing.\nThe U.N. climate talks failed to deliver increased cuts in carbon pollution, nor did they provide any credible pathway to $100 billion per year in finance by 2020 to help the poorest countries deal with climate change, according to the 700 NGOs who are members of Climate Action Network-International (CAN-I).\n While the Doha talks were supposed to lead to a binding deal in 2015 to cut emissions, countries like the U.S. battled on the issue of equity and the polluters pay principle. The whole attempt was to get developing countries to commit themselves to reducing emissions as well and go against the principles of equity. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s betrayal\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Tim Gore, International Climate Change Policy Adviser for Oxfam, said Doha had done nothing to guarantee that public climate finance would go up next year, and not go down. \u201cDeveloping countries have come here in good faith and have been forced to accept vague words and no numbers,\u201d Mr. Gore said. \u201cIt\u2019s a betrayal.\u201d \n The Gateway has failed to come up with any commitment on midterm finance for the Green Climate Fund or any specified amount of finance. There is an eight-year second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol with loopholes that allow carry over, use and trading of hot air, say NGOs.\nThe developing countries did manage to push through a work programme on loss and damage and a decision to establish something on the lines of an international mechanism for loss and damage by the next climate talks in end-2013, which the U.S. is resisting. \n\u201cThe blame for the disaster in Doha can be laid squarely at the door of countries like the U.S.A. which have blocked and bullied those who are serious about tackling climate change,\u201d says Asad Rehman, Friends of the Earth International.\n\n\u2018Hot air\u2019 Kyoto credits\n\nKumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International, in a statement, said: \u201cThe talks in Doha were always going to be a modest affair, but they failed to live up to even the historically low expectations. \u201cThe pace of progress is glacial. This time Europe, usually seen as a leader on climate change, comes away with dirty hands. Due to a collective failure of political courage, European governments chose to take the side of Poland, which demanded the right to keep \u2018hot air\u2019 Kyoto credits awarded to them in the 1990s. Europe also refused to go beyond a 20 per cent target, which would barely decrease them emissions from today\u2019s levels.\u201d\n\nTyphoon Bhopa\n\n The Philippines witnessed its 16{+t}{+h}extreme climate event during the conference and typhoon Bhopa devastated parts of the country which had not seen such destruction for 40 years. While the world negotiates year after year, it has failed to get developed countries to accept their historical responsibility. Instead of commitments, there is a gateway for the developed nations to resist action.\n\n\nDoha has opened up new gateway to bigger ambition, greater action: Al-Attiyah\n\n\n\n\nTalks failed to live up to even historically low expectations: Greenpeace International\n\n\n"

Ramakrishna Pillai made the observation while allowing an appeal filed by the Union Ministry of Tourism against a single judge directive to grant star classification to certain hotels without insisting on a valid bar licence.\nWhen the appeal came up for hearing, the State government took the stand that the star hotels would be granted FL3 licence only if the High Court or the Supreme Court issued an order to the effect.\nThis was because an appeal against a High Court order quashing the Foreign Liquor Rule amendments removing three-star hotels from the category entitled to bar licence was pending.\nThe court observed that the State government should have been straight rather than leaving the bar licence issues to the Supreme Court or the High Court to decide.\nMaybe because the government did not want to take a clear or definite stand in this regard in view of the appeal pending before the Supreme Court.\nThe Bench said governmental function could not be passed off by saying that it would depend on the decision of the Supreme Court or the High Court.\nThe State government had to take a definite stand as the abkari policy was in the realm of the State.\n\nCentre\u2019s argument\n\nThe Centre pointed out that as per clause 8 (f) of the General Terms, Conditions and Application Format for Approval of Hotels, bar licence was not mandatory if the local law did not permit bar licence for hotels.\nIn case the law allowed bars in hotels, then the hotel needs to obtain bar licence before applying for classification. The Centre contended that the scheme of classification of hotels was a voluntary scheme and the guidelines for the same had been formulated keeping in mind the laws of the land.\nThe Centre contended that ratings provided by its Ministry of Tourism for hotels should not be taken as a criterion by the State government for granting bar licence.\nThe Bench, while allowing the appeal, directed the Union Ministry of Tourism to send the applications received by it to the Regional Director, Indian Tourism, Southern Region, Chennai, for considering them and pass orders as if they are applications for three star classifications.\n\n\nCalls upon government to take definite stand\n\n\n\n\nSays licence issues should not be left to Supreme Court\n\n\n"

            "body": "Once India\u2019s leading telecom operator and a Navratna, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd.\u2019s (BSNL) finances now paint a scary picture of a company on critical life support and in the absence of immediate attention, with very little hope of survival.\nBSNL\u2019s losses for the last three years already exceed $3 billion at Rs.17,058 crore. This is in spite of the fact that it registered a whopping income of Rs.89,667 crore or $16 billion but outclassed that with an expenditure of Rs.1,07,095 crore or nearly $20 billion, far in excess of this income. [See chart].\nIronically, in the same period that BSNL has seen a steady decline, the telecom sector, in the last decade has gone on to produce several new billionaires.\nWhen contacted, Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal told The Hindu that the main crisis was on account of 45 per cent of BSNL\u2019s income going towards salaries as against a 4-5 per cent-level in the private sector.\n\u201cWe are working on an attractive Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) and will eventually boost incomes by leveraging BSNL\u2019s real estate bank, renting out its telecom towers and fibre optics capacity.\u201d\n\nElusive\n\nThe perfect prescription for BSNL\u2019s revival remains elusive. Sam Pitroda, Adviser to the Prime Minister, had headed a committee to review BSNL\u2019s operations in 2009-10. The committee had recommended selection of the best professionals from the private sector at market rates, and appointment of an eminent person from the private sector as chairman. It suggested separating the post of Managing Director/CEO from CMD and a change of the board\u2019s composition to seven directors \u2014 one internal MD/CEO, one non-executive chairman, two government nominees and three external directors.\n\nThree-year contracts\n\nMr. Pitroda had recommended providing three-year contracts with specific targets for all key management team members and establishing four independent business units for Fixed Access, Mobility, Enterprise and New Businesses. On the human resource side, the committee had recommended completing the Indian Telecom Service (ITS) absorption process while inducting significant young talent in technology, IT, marketing and sales. A sharp reduction was also suggested through retirement or transfer of one lakh employees through processes such as VRS.\n\nDisinvestment\n\nMr. Pitroda had further recommended disinvesting 30 per cent stake through a strategic Indian investor and an initial public offering (IPO) of which 10 per cent should be returned to the government and 20 per cent used for BSNL\u2019s employee VRS, expansion and operations.\nHe had targeted providing 30 million new high-speed broadband connections in the next three years and significantly, unbundling local loop for public and private companies. He also recommended setting up of two separate subsidiary companies for tower-related infrastructure and land bank and other real estate assets.\nThe Telecom Commission deliberated these recommendations and then set up an Internal Committee led by Member Services. The Internal Committee submitted its recommendations on October 29, 2010, based on which the Telecom Commission decided that taking 30-50 professionals from the market at market rates, changing the board constitution or separating the posts of chairman and MD may not be feasible in only one public sector undertaking (PSU) as it may simultaneously trigger protests from BSNL and demand for similar treatment by other PSUs.Further, the Telecom Commission felt this was not the opportune time for listing and disinvestment of BSNL, as the company was on a downward performance path and disinvestment might not realise the true value of the company. In the absence of listing, option of giving stocks as incentive to key management is also not available.\nOn the issue of VRS, the panel said that an across-the-board scheme might not be required; BSNL could examine the option of VRS for select categories, examining financial burden and cost/benefit of the company.\nOn issues of adopting a managed capacity or managed services model \u2014 the view of the Internal Committee that the BSNL Board may take a view \u2014 was endorsed, while unbundling of the local loop was a commercial decision, which should be decided by BSNL board after critically examining the issue. On all other issues relating to BSNL\u2019s operational and commercial issues, the Committee has left the decision to the BSNL board.\nThe Telecom Commission also said that it might revisit its decisions relating to disinvestment, VRS and unbundling of local loop \u201cif the need arose in the context of any major policy decisions involving restructuring and repositioning of BSNL.\u201d\n"

Sundara Rao, to wait for the loudspeakers to go silent, but he goes on playing the percussion instrument: he has all but lost his hearing.\nAdamsha and his family members have converted to Islam and there is none in the family who is interested in mastering the kunthalam, now a rare and vanishing instrument.\n\u201cToday, the opportunity to play the instrument is few and far between. The income is too meagre to run a family, so I asked our family members to opt for some other profession,\u201d said the Maharashtrian, whose family settled in Thanjavur hundreds of years ago, when the region was ruled by Maratha kings.\nKunthalam was the instrument of choice in folk performances, though it was used occasionally in classical performances, especially in nagaswaram concerts.\nIn the super-hit film Nandanar starring M.M. Dhandapani Desikar, there is a scene in which beats of the kunthalam help an oracle go into a trance.\nHowever, the instrument was soon replaced by Nayyandi Melam troupes ubiquitous in Keezha Vasal, Reddipalyam and Vadakku Vasal in Thanjavur.\nThough very small, the kunthalam can produce high-pitched sounds and Sundara Rao gave a demonstration on how it is used on different occasions. \u201cIt can also produce sollu normally played on the thavil.\u201d\nBesides Rao, his nephew Dadabhai, who lives in Keezha Vasal, is probably the only other man still alive who can play the instrument. His nephew Jeeva Rao also plays, but no one else, says Dadabhai.\nKunthalam was used as an accompaniment to Poikal Kuthirai dance, an art form introduced to Tamil Nadu by artistes from Maharashtra. Sundara Rao himself was an accomplished Poikal Kuthirai artiste, but gave it up long ago although he continues playing the kunthalam. The instrument is also played on the occasion of Pal Kudam procession, Sakthi Karagam and Kali Aatam.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult instrument to learn. You have to fold three of your fingers while playing the instrument and when you are learning to play, your fingers often bleed. So, not many youngsters are coming forward to learn it,\u201d explained 73-year old Dadabhai, who as a boy quit school to follow the family profession.\nKunthalam resembles the tabla, but the two pieces \u2014 valanthalai and thoopi \u2014 are joined together. Thoppi is made of goat skin and fibre skin is used for valanthalai. A flexible stick from Aavaram plant, designed like a question mark, is used for playing the thoppi and another small stick for valanthalai.\n\u201cThough I have accompanied many thavil players, the instrument has its limitations. It cannot match thavil when it comes to producing korvais and sollus. In thavil, they use four fingers and in kunthalam you can use only one finger. But you can use it beautifully while playing for uruppadis and cinema songs,\u201d said Dadabhai.\nAt one part of time the instrument was so famous, the place inhabited by kunthalam artistes in Vadakku Vasal was known as Kunthalakara Theru (Kunthalakara Street). Today, it sounds like a misnomer as there is none, except Sundara Rao.\nDadabhai says there are many kunthalam artistes in Maharashtra, but in Tamil Nadu the sound of the instrument seems to have faded away.\n"

            "body": "At the end of the long wait for wages facing many workers employed under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), there remains a long journey to the bank or post office before the cash they earned is placed in their hands. It could be a 30 km trekked by foot, a bus ride alone for women, or a lost day\u2019s work. But in three Madhya Pradesh districts, workers no longer have to make the journey, the cash comes to them.\nVans equipped with a cashier cum clerk and a security guard travel between gram panchayat offices and even, when necessary, MGNREGS work sites, to deliver cash to workers. In Annapur, the six hard-top vehicles \u2014 or \u201cmobile banking units,\u201d as they\u2019re called \u2014 financed in January 2010 through the district\u2019s central cooperative bank \u201cApki Bank Aapke Dwar\u201d scheme, helped 730 people receive payment each day that year, according to a PowerPoint promoting the programme.\nIn it the mobile banking units\u2019 first journeys through the villages are shown. The vans are draped with banners and orange marigolds, with lines of women waiting to receive payment from the clerk through the passenger window.\nIt\u2019s a sight the Ministry of Rural Development would like to see repeated throughout India, as delayed wage payments persist, particularly among post offices, Minister of Rural Development Jairam Ramesh said. \u201cThe entire credibility and value of MGNREGS is threatened by continued delays in wage payments through post offices\u2026\u201d Mr. Ramesh said in a November letter addressed to Kapil Sibal, Minister of Communications & Informational Technology.\nIn the letter, Mr. Ramesh urged States to use mobile banking vans outfitted with satellite connectivity as a temporary fix to distance and delayed wages as the government works to bring post offices under a core banking solution similar to that found in banks. Under Mr. Ramesh\u2019s proposal, the vans would follow the same milk routes mapped out by dairy cooperatives.\nMobile banking has for years been discussed as a potential solution to the long payment wait, said social activist Nikhil Dey, while government infrastructure still struggles to meet the MGNREGS\u2019 aims. As many as 200,000 gram panchayats throughout India still lack banks where workers can access their wages, he said.\nThe distance, coupled with administrative snares, as well as understaffed and under-equipped facilities, has led to wage payment delays that run well past the 15 days mandated by the landmark 2005 Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) that seeks to ensure 100 days of work each year for the rural poor. Delays of one month are common, Mr. Dey said, but a single misprinted digit on a job card might result in an \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d wait of two to three years.\n\u201cThese are people mostly living on a hand-to-mouth existence,\u201d he added. \u201cThe whole point was that they would have access to money when they needed it.\u201d\nAs such, he would like to see the programme tried out in one district in every State.\nThe scheme is underway in Annupur, Balaghat, and Khandwa districts in Madhya Pradesh\u2019s, said Aruna Sharma, the principal secretary for rural development in the State, where distances between banks have already been reduced to 5 km as the result of the State\u2019s efforts to build 4,000 new small banks and post offices there. The vans make that distance even less \u2014 because \u201cwhy should an individual walk even 5 km?\u201d Ms. Sharma said. The smaller distances have shortened lines at the bank, brought the waiting time for wages from an average of 2 to 3 months to 3 to10 days, and has caused workers to save more of their money.\nBut Ritesh Saxena, a Management Information System officer in the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), stressed that the vans would not resolve the wage disbursement problem in the long term. \u201cIt\u2019s a good interim solution because nothing else is there,\u201d he said, estimating that the costs of outfitting a single van and paying its staff could run as high as Rs. 20 lakh.\nThe cash-laden vans might also prove a security hazard in districts affected by Maoist violence, Mr. Dey pointed out. Or, as Neelakshi Mann, a Monitoring and Evaluations Officer in the MRD put it, \u201cthey\u2019d be sitting ducks.\u201d\nEven Ms. Sharma does not favour the vans as a long term solution. Though she says a van would run the state or the private banks that financed it less money, she still wants to see \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d financial buildings in her State far more than roving van banks. There have been cases where business correspondents \u2014 the mobile equivalent used by some banks \u2014 have taken off with the money, she said. \u201cIt is very important for people, when they put their money somewhere, to be confident that it\u2019s a permanent structure.\u201d\nBesides, she noted, handing out workers\u2019 wages is only part of the goals of financial inclusion proposed by MGNREGA. At a full service banking facility, the rural poor could do much more to lift themselves from poverty, like take loans, she said. \u201cWhat we are saying is that they should gain access instead of just having access.\u201d\n"

It is the antithesis of gallery art and seeks to conjure up a \u2018carnival\u2019 world, in Mikhail Bhaktin\u2019s lingo, where the sublime, the ordinary, the kitschy and the profane jostle for space. While India boasts a robust history of hosting triennales beginning 1968 when the legendary Mulk Raj Anand leveraged his clout to bring the who\u2019s who of global art to India, the Kochi-Muziris Biennale that opens at the culturally-rich Fort Kochi on Wednesday (12/12/12) is the first of its kind for more than one reason, placing equal thrust on contemporary art and traditional folk and classical arts from various parts of India.\nThe epoch-making art carnival has over 80 artists from 24 countries, half of them Indian, presenting their installations (site-specific, multimedia and so on), paintings, sculptures, films and performing arts over the next three months at 14 venues spread across Fort Kochi, Mattancherry and Ernakulam. Though dogged by controversies, the Kochi Biennale Foundation has been able to \u2018fight the odds\u2019 and \u2018overcome the hurdles\u2019 and get off to a steady start in a bid to catalyse a \u201ccultural shift through social and political engagement,\u201d as Riyas Komu, secretary of the Kochi Biennale Foundation and co- curator of the event, put it.\nThe effort is to shape an alternative cultural discourse on a platform for artists, political thinkers, art lovers, collectors, students and researchers from the around the world. \u201cWe are putting our best foot forward hoping this will become a bi-annual pilgrimage for artists around the globe to gather and exchange ideas,\u201d he said.\nThe Kochi-Muziris Biennale, after the ancient port city of Muziris which is believed to have existed in the region as its gateway of trade, features some big names in the global art circuit such as Ariel Hassan (Argentina), Ernesto Neto (Brazil), Joseph Semah (Israeli based in Amsterdam), Rigo 23 (Portugal), Amanullah Mojadidi (American-Afghanistan) and Jonas Staal (The Netherlands), some of them fashioning site-specific installations. A host of eminent Indian artists such as Subodh Gupta, Vivan Sundaram, Sheela Gowda, Sudarshan Shetty, Amar Kanwar and K.P. Reji adds a different dimension to the grand narrative.\nIn fact, the biennale has already begun informally. Work is apace on public installations \u2014 the most notable among them being a creative sculpture of Chinnathampi Annavi, the founder of Biblical dance-theatre with Portuguese elements \u2018Chavittunatakam,\u2019 unique to the erstwhile Muziris region \u2014 and site-specific evolutionary works in and around Fort Kochi.\nArtists, researchers and students from around the globe have descended on the city to bask in the electric ambience of the place.\nAnother unique feature of the biennale is its prodigious segment on indigenous performing and folk arts, which got under way almost a month ago. Unfolding as part of it are gems from the ancient Sanskrit theatre, Nangiarkoothu, Chavittunatakam, regional Islamic music and martial arts, all curated by Keli Ramachandran.\nAlso on the cards are contemporary Malayalam theatre performances, Ghazals, Sanskrit theatre Koodiyattom, Kathakali besides Kerala\u2019s folk, percussion and ritualistic art. Meanwhile, noted art administrator K. Subhas Chandran is curating a performing Indian arts segment with Hindustani music, a Rudra veena recital, Manipuri dance, the Sattriya dance of Assam, chamber orchestra and a choral group with 40 singers.\nA symposium on the issues of cosmopolitanism, modernity and cultural identities and the screening of films curated by auteur Adoor Gopalakrishnan will add to the biennale\u2019s plurality.\nThe Kochi Corporation has already declared Kochi a \u2018biennale city\u2019 and the stamp is manifest on the streets of Fort Kochi that dots freshly-made street art and graffiti.\n\u201cI have been to biennales in Venice [the oldest], Havana, Johannesburg and so on and the Kochi-Muziris Biennale is no less complex in scale, magnitude and dimension. It is amazing that there is a theatre festival going with it, and there\u2019s a stark political discourse set off by a team from Holland, just to cite its range. The choice of location is half the game won. The build-up was exciting and I\u2019m sure it is going to be phenomenal,\u201d remarked Vivan Sundaram.\n\n\nElectric ambience in the place with the arrival of global artists and researchers\n\n\n\n\nKochi Biennale on the lines of those in Venice, Havana etc: Vivan Sundaram\n\n\n"

He wants this election, like the last one, to be a referendum on Moditva, with six crore Gujaratis ranged behind him against the rest of India.\nGodhra and the anti-Muslim pogrom that followed it in 2002 made him the face of Gujarati Hindu political identity: today, it may not be an election issue, but ever so often, it floats just beneath the surface in conversations, both in towns and villages. Mr. Modi\u2019s admirers, while listing his achievements, never fail to point out that there has been \u201cpeace\u201d for a decade \u2014 any question about the state of the cases is brushed aside. Gujarati pride and the communal divide \u2014 not the so-called Gujarat model and his vision of development \u2014 still remain Mr. Modi\u2019s most potent weapons in his battle to retain power.\nBut after 11 years of Narendra Modi at the helm, there are signs of fatigue, and anti-incumbency against many sitting MLAs: this time, thanks to the entry of Keshubhai Patel\u2019s Gujarat Parivartan Party in the electoral fray, Mr. Modi has not changed as many candidates as he would have wished to. And some Gujaratis have even begun to see through the dazzle of Vibrant Gujarat. For, even as the real estate sector booms, builders and contractors have a field day, and the Tatas and the Adanis shower praise on Mr. Modi, on the ground, the narrative is very different.\nThe State\u2019s social indicators, in many cases, continue to be less than the national average; and even as government schools languish, the emphasis is on private educational institutions that are out of the reach of the common man. Village commons \u2014 grazing land \u2014 have been handed over to industrialists causing disquiet in rural Gujarat. And the super highways that crisscross the State and the gleaming malls in its big cities cannot, for instance, compensate for the impact of scanty rainfall in Saurashtra in the absence of any alternative arrangements by the government to address the severe water crisis.\nOver the last decade, Mr. Modi has also emasculated the State bureaucracy: an IAS officer who retired recently told this writer, \u201cDistrict magistrates in Gujarat have been converted into event managers for his many melas \u2014 they are no longer capable of doing real work.\u201d Indeed, when Mr. Modi\u2019s acolytes say government servants don\u2019t like working hard, he says, it actually means that they find it tedious \u2014 and expensive \u2014 mobilising huge crowds for the Chief Minister. There is, after all, no legitimate government head under which to list expenses incurred on buses etc to ferry people. \u201cThe distinction between government and party, in the process, has blurred,\u201d says the officer. Little wonder when the rains failed in Saurashtra this year, there was no response from the administration.\nIf he has weakened the bureaucracy, centralisation of power \u2014 in Mr. Modi and a few key aides in Gandhinagar \u2014 has meant the BJP organisation, too, is not as strong as it once was. There is a show of unity, but the enthusiasm is lacking. At rallies, he repeatedly urges voters to think of him when they cast their votes, not the candidate. Having severed links with RSS leaders in the State, election-time samanvay baithaks in every constituency have been abandoned. At these coordination meetings, representatives of all RSS organisations would gather periodically to discuss the campaign\u2019s progress to introduce correctives: this has now been replaced by Mr. Modi\u2019s team monitoring each constituency from Gandhinagar.\nIndeed, Gujarat is ripe for change: it\u2019s just the Congress could have done much more to tap the dissensions within the sangh parivar and the discontent on the ground. Its inability to project a leader, infighting over the distribution of tickets and, in recent days, the crossing over of senior leader Narhari Amin to the BJP have all affected the optics. But the Congress\u2019 choice of candidates has, on the whole, been fairly good, its advertising campaign \u2014 posing the aam aadmi against Mr. Modi \u2014 has been surprisingly effective. And it has had one big success \u2014 its ghar nu ghar scheme, the promise to provide housing for the urban poor, with registration in the name of the woman has created such waves that Mr. Modi has promised 50 lakh homes over the next five years. The Congress is hoping the GPP will win five to ten seats and cut into the BJP\u2019s votes in another 10-20 constituencies and help it add 20 seats to its 2007 tally of 59 seats.\nIf Mr. Modi\u2019s biggest plus point is the lack of an equivalent face in the Congress, it is also a fact that there are many in the State \u2014 especially women and young men in urban Gujarat \u2014 who worship him. Shortly after a 3D show in Padra, near Vadodadra, a group of young men \u2014 a schoolteacher, a petty businessman and a farmer \u2014 stand mesmerised after watching a \u201cvirtual\u201d Modi. \u201cIt only shows how advanced we are in Gujarat,\u201d the schoolteacher says with the enthusiasm of one who just acquired the latest I-phone. In a diamond bourse in Surat, traders and stockbrokers who deal in this precious gem surround me: \u201cModi is engraved in our hearts,\u201d they shout, \u201che is a lion.\u201d Indeed, it is among the urban middle class that he has the largest number of votaries. After delimitation, the number of urban seats has climbed from 60 to 73.\nThe Congress\u2019 strategy is to contain the BJP tally to less than 100 (92 is a majority). It\u2019s a high-stake election for Mr. Modi: to achieve his ambition of becoming the BJP\u2019s prime ministerial candidate for 2014, he has to do more than scrape through \u2014 he needs to retain the 117 seats he now has.\n"

In the study carried out by scientists from CSIR-National Geophysical Research Institute here, researchers from the School of Geography Science, Nanjing Normal University and the School of Earth Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China collaborated in dating the fossils.\nA paper relating to the study was published in \u2018Marine Geology\u2019, an Elsevier publication.\nAccording to Dr. S.Masood Ahmad, Chief Scientist at NGRI and the lead author, the fossil shells (foraminifera) found at a water depth of more than 3,000 metres were collected for the study. He said that using oxygen isotopes deposited in fossil shells, the temperature details of the sea water of the past thousands of years could be studied.\n\u201cWe have seen using well-dated sediment cores from NEIO that there was a connection between its sea surface temperature and North Atlantic climate oscillations\u201d.\nHe said that studies in the past had shown that changes in Indian southwest and northeast monsoon even on shorter time-scales were associated with cold and warm events in the North Atlantic. He said that cold winds from Northern polar region have influenced low latitude regions like the Indian Ocean during last glacial period (20,000 to 60,000 years ago). This had happened at intervals of every 4,000-5,000 years through atmosphere.\nStating that the Indian monsoon was much more intense 6,000-8,000 years ago, Dr. Masood said the freshwater influxes were much more intense than the present influxes like the Ganges and Brahmaputra. \u201cThere might be some reasons for it. We are trying to establish them,\u201d he added.\nHe said that it was also observed that the temperature was two to three degrees less during the last glacial maximum (21,000 years ago) period compared to the present. During the same period, the South West monsoon activity was much lower and the conditions were almost arid at that time.\nDr. Masood said they were trying to correlate North Atlantic climate connection from land records too by studying cave deposits occurring in different parts of the Indian sub-continent. Such studies would not only throw light on past monsoon behaviour but also help in developing predictive models for future, he added.\n"

Krishnamani, who were present in the court, to give their valuable suggestions in deciding the case.\nThe question involved in the case is whether the oath taken by the appellant, Umesh Challiyil, then a member of the Kerala Assembly, in the name of Sree Narayana Guru, whom he considers and believes as God, under Article 188 of the Constitution was liable to be declared invalid on the ground that it was not in the form prescribed in the third schedule of the Constitution.\nMr. Challiyil of the Janadhipathya Samrakshana Samiti was sworn in as Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in 2001 in the name of the Guru on his winning the election from Kodungalloor. The Kerala High Court, acting on a writ petition filed by Haridas from Kozhikode, held that the oath \u201cdoes not conform to the constitutional mandate, since the form prescribes the oath to be taken in the name of God or solemnly affirmed, whereas he took oath in the name of Sree Narayana Guru.\u201d\nAssailing the verdict, Mr. Challiyil said \u201cthe High Court went wrong in not considering the real purpose of mandate under Article 188 of the Constitution, that the member of the State Legislature should take pledge that he will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution and also uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, and as a guarantee for this, he should take oath in the name of God. Therefore, there is nothing wrong if he takes oath in the name of Sree Narayana Guru whom he considers and believes as God.\u201d\nHe said the High Court also went wrong in holding that the oath should be taken exactly in the form given in the third schedule. Article 188 says: \u201cEvery member of the Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council of a State shall, before taking his seat, make and subscribe before the Governor, or some person appointed in that behalf by him, an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the third schedule.\u201d\nThe form of oath provided under the third schedule for the member of the State Legislature reads: \u201cI, A.B., having been elected (or nominated) a member of the Legislative Assembly (or Legislative Council), do swear in the name of God/ solemnly affirm that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India and that I will faithfully discharge the duty upon which I am about to enter.\u2019\u2019\nThe appellant said \u201cit is seen that the mandate under Article 188 is to take oath in accordance with the form and therefore there is nothing wrong in naming the God or using the name of the Guru, whom he considers as God. If the form set out in the third schedule is substantially followed, it has to be treated as it is in accordance with the prescribed form and the contrary view taken by the High Court is unsustainable.\u201d He sought a direction to quash the impugned judgment.\nThe Bench directed that the matter be listed for further hearing on February 6, 2013.\n"

He said 794 hectares of land would have to be acquired for the project, estimated to cost Rs.1,18,000 crore. \u201cTunnels, bridges, and overhead piers have been proposed in the project report to obviate the need for large-scale displacement of families.

MPs and MLAs had been kept in the dark about the project, he alleged.\n\nSexual abuse\n\nMr. Chandy assured the House that the government would take steps to protect young victims of sexual abuse. Replying to a submission by Shafi Parambil on the increasing incidents of parental abuse and atrocities against girls, he said stern action would be taken to curb such tendencies.\nMr. Chandy said legal action would have to be supplemented with steps to protect the victims.

A signature protest campaign in support of Dr. Bilham has already been launched following Dr. Wyss\u2019s presentation.\nThe MHA officials, however, are not willing to say for what kind of visa violation Dr. Bilham was put on a flight back to the USA shortly on arrival. Repeated efforts were of no avail. It stands to reason that he could not have committed any during his May visit because he was still in the airport. And his last visit was on an official invitation. Both the DST and the Ministry of Earth Sciences are not aware of this incident.\nBut in an allegation that is hard to verify, Dr. Bilham has further claimed that a senior highly influential Indian seismologist has conspired to have his name included in the MHA list. This he has even officially communicated to the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) while declining the institute\u2019s request to be the external examiner for adjudicating a Ph. D. student\u2019s thesis.\nIn his October 17 letter, Dr. Bilham wrote to the IISc Registrar: \u201cI regret to inform you that the Government of India has decided that I am no longer allowed to visit India. This is not a visa issue but a blacklisting issue. The governmental decision was presumably based on recommendations made by one or more influential seismologists in India. The decision is based on a recent article on Indian seismicity similar to that discussed in the thesis that you mention\u2026I am concerned that my presence on the thesis committee\u2026will be detrimental to the future of this talented young scientist.\u201d\nHis name, Dr. Bilham said in his email, continued to be on the prohibited list until last week when he wanted to make a trip to India to visit the Delhi Archives.\n"

Most of the garbage being taken out of bins by thousands of ragpickers on a daily basis is strewn all around to facilitate easy identification of recyclable items in the garbage. The ragpickers fail to put the garbage back in the bins, thereby spoiling entire stretches on roads, the study had found.\nUnder the new system, generated garbage will be collected directly from homes and packed in specially-designed reusable bags by conservancy workers.\nThe garbage bags will be taken on tricycles to the garbage enclosures set up by the civic body. Trucks will then transport the bags to the dumping yards.\nConservancy workers will ensure reuse by cleaning the bags and using them again for garbage collection. The new system is likely to require more conservancy workers and tricycles than are there under the existing system.\nA few years ago, the civic body had initiated similar alternative methods, including \u2018bell conservancy.\u2019 The system failed after a period of successful conservancy operations on some streets that were covered by dedicated workers. Segregation of garbage was successfully carried out in many areas under the system, said officials, adding that the new system would also be a stepping stone for source segregation.\nThe civic body carried out the study following the recent spate of protest by residents affected by inadequate garbage clearance. The new system is likely to be tried in areas not covered by private conservancy operators.\nRamky Enviro Engineers, which has been collecting, segregating and transporting municipal solid waste in three zones since January 1, will continue to implement its own micro plan of action for conservancy operations.\n"

This is one of the green initiatives undertaken by the industrial estate as part of its golden jubilee celebration.\nMembers of the Association said residents from neighbouring areas visited the water body regularly for fishing. During weekends, people thronged the area with fishing gear.

To commemorate his 130th birth anniversary, we spoke with three persons who have, in distinct ways, carried on his legacy. Like all poets after Bharathi, lyricist Vairamuthu has been influenced by his verses, often adopting his persona in person and on paper.\nFilmmaker K. Balachander drew deeply from Bharathi\u2019s social consciousness. His films, many of them trendsetters, explored themes of societal change and empowerment of women. For Rajkumar Bharathi, the poet\u2019s great-grandson, the legacy was more of a challenge. He embraced and transcended it by giving ardent devotees of Bharathi something priceless \u2013 songs, in tunes the poet had composed.K. Balachander\nThe history of Tamils can be split into \u2018before Bharathi\u2019 and \u2018after Bharathi\u2019. Such is the impact of that poet. Bharathi is my superhero. As a boy, I was awestruck by his patriotism, devotion, active social awareness. The effect he had on me percolated into my cinema.\nThe strength and refreshing pride my women characters portrayed were imbued from his verses. Poverty never mellowed his fire or dampened his ideals. His used his words as weapons against injustices. Bharathi is needed now more than ever. As corruption and avarice run riot, who among us does not wish he were with us?\nFor a video, go to http://thne.ws/bharathi- balachander\n\nVairamuthu\n\nA good poet draws inspiration and sustenance from the time or age he lives in. A great poet, a \u2018Mahakavi\u2019, transforms the time he lives in. \nAfter Kamban, Tamil waited for 800 years for a void to be filled. Until Bharathi arrived, Tamil was a tool for entertainment, for mundane worship; it was a jumble of sound. Bharathi wielded it as a weapon against oppression, made it a language for the future, a conduit for development. With it, he transformed devotion into patriotism.\nFor a video, go to http://thne.ws/bharathi-\nvairamuthu\n\nRajkumar Bharathi\n\nWhat is the ideal tribute to the indelible verses of Subramanya Bharathi? It is to understand, assimilate and put them to practice.\nToday, there is palpable love for Bharathi, but a chasm still exists between society and his dreams for it. Until that chasm is bridged, there is no next step.\nHis sense of responsibility, his repeated call for love, for an undivided India, is relevant to this day.\nHe wielded the strongest pen for the uplift of women. I am lucky to have been born in this lineage.\nAs a boy, everyone glorified him and so did I. It was only over the last 10 or 15 years that I began to truly understand him.\nThe grandness of his vision, his impatience, his anxiety \u2014 I get that now. Bharathi was ahead of his times. He remains ahead of ours, too.\n"

After repeated violations, we have decided to cancel his license and he has agreed to step down from his position as TEDx ambassador in India. We do not make these decisions hastily, and this particular decision came after consulting with the TEDx community, TEDx ambassadors and Kiruba.\u201d\nKiruba Shankar, licensee and curator of TEDxChennai, and ambassador of TEDx in India, confirmed he had stepped down as the ambassador.\nThe letter by the TEDx team addressed to TEDx India licensees which was circulating online also raised a larger objection about repeated violations of TEDx rules in India.\nTEDx, is an off-shoot of TED, a not-for-profit initiative that lends a platform to achievers and thinkers from diverse fields such as design, technology, science and literature to present their most inspirational ideas in 18 minutes or less. TEDx follows the same format, but is planned and co-ordinated independently at the community level. A TEDx organiser must first obtain a TEDx license from TED.\nThe letter states that it had recently come to their attention that TEDxChennai had flouted rules by \u201cholding a press conference with sponsors, having a venue sponsor as a speaker on stage and speakers that were part of another conference.\u201d\nResponding to these allegations, Kiruba, while agreeing that rules were flouted, maintained that it was not for monetary gain. \u201cIt was not done with any ill-intention, and when I look at it in hindsight, I should have been careful,\u201d he said. Responding to the specific allegations, he said, \u201cThe press conference was organised at Park Sheraton, which was one of the sponsors. We had a venue with a seating capacity of 1,200 to fill up, and logistically, this event was on a much larger scale than the ones that were organised in 2009 and 2010.\u201d\nHowever, he refuted the second allegation by saying that they had two options, of which they chose the second. \u201cPrabakaran Murugaiah, one of the speakers offered to help with the venue. So, we could either have him pay and not have him speak, or vice-versa and we chose the second. We covered the cost of the venue through our ticket sales,\u201d he said.\nWhen the same funding and speakers of a TEDx event are used in an event close to the date of the event, TEDx calls its co-branding, and prohibits it. On this, Mr. Shankar agreed that the 17 speakers spoke at a school and a college prior to the TEDxChennai event held in September.\nOn the renewal of the license in future, Ms. Stein, said, \u201cKiruba was advised on a Skype call that his license would not be renewed.\u201d\n"

As publishing houses depend on library orders, printed books are gathering dust in godowns,\u201d said writer Manushyaputhiran, who also runs Uyirmai Pathipagam.\nHe has joined hands with the Tamil Nadu Progressive Writers and Artistes Association, which has been fighting for the publishers.\n\u201cThe government purchased books making use of the fund allotted by the Centre from the Raja Ram Mohan Roy Trust. Each year it get Rs. 5 crore and only a few publishers benefit from the purchase,\u201d said Nagarajan of Bharathi Pathipagam.\nMr. Nagarajan pointed out that every year, the government collected library cess from the public to the tune of Rs. 180 crore, but the money was not utilised.\n\nTerrible situation\n\n\u201cSmall publishers are left in the lurch and we are not able to give royalties to writers, who depend on income from writing for their livelihood. It is a terrible situation,\u201d said Mr Nagarajan, who has been instrumental in bringing together a couple of writers and publishers together on a platform.\nManushyaputhiran said while modern technology combined with computer knowledge ushered in a revolution in the publishing industry in Tamil Nadu, the DMK government\u2019s decision to buy 1,000 copies of each book gave further fillip. But the situation changed for the worse as the government remains indifferent. Sample copies were collected last in 2009 and no purchase orders were issued. But in 2010 and 2011, even sample copies were not purchased.\n\u201cIn Tamil Nadu, it is very difficult to sell books through retail sales. A publisher can sell a maximum of 300 copies in the open market and he totally depends on government for support,\u201d said Manushyaputhiran.\nAccording to Manushyaputhiran, BAPASI had the duty to bring the issue to the government\u2019s notice, but it was not making any effort.\n\u201cThey are afraid of raising the issue because they fear that their publication will be blacklisted,\u201d said the writer, adding that he would soon observe an indefinite fast in support of the demand of publishers.\n\n\nBooks have not been purchased for 4000-odd public libraries since 2009\n\n\n"

But for those at the centre, this Australian-born nun\u2019s presence is still tangible.\nOne of eight siblings in a large family, then 26-year-old Sister Mary left Australia and came to India in 1951, and later Mylapore, because as her niece Ms. Mahoney put it, \u201call she ever wanted to be was a nun\u201d.\nSister Mary, who joined the Franciscan Missionaries, decided to start MITHRA (Madras Institute to Habilitate Retarded Afflicted) in March 1977, to care for the differently-abled. \u201cShe did not return to Australia for almost 30 years after she left,\u201d recalls Ms. Malouf.\n\u201cShe had a special gift with the children at MITHRA, she brought out the best attributes in them,\u201d says, Ms. Malouf, adding, \u201cShe once narrated how the children refused to be put to bed until she arrived on a midnight flight.\u201d\nIn a recording of Sister Mary played at the centre on Monday, she speaks emphatically about how she wants to help differently-abled children do \u201csomething beautiful\u201d.\nBrother Rob Callen, who has been bringing students from Australia to intern here for the past 25 years, recalls how the centre had simple buildings and roofs made of palm-leaves back then. The centre now has an occupational therapy unit, physiotherapy unit, a school, vocational training unit, hostel, a tailoring unit, and the Shrine of Divine Mercy.\nV.C. Hemalatha, principal, St. Rose\u2019s Special School, observes that several students who passed out of the school, are now employed at the institution itself. The school, which has a total strength of 175, has both day scholars as well as residential students.\n\u201cSr. Mary was very involved in the running of the school and the performance of students. The teachers had to report to her on given days, and brief her about the running. When she was well, she would come everyday to school and interact with the students,\u201d Ms. Hemalatha says. On what lies ahead, Ms. Mahoney says that three Servite Sisters have been working with her aunt since January to advance her vision for this institution. One of them is Sister Rosamma.\n\u201cEver since I came, she was bed-ridden, but that did not deter her from being involved. She would always refer to students by their names, and inquire about the students\u2019 progress,\u201d says the sister. \u201cShe loved cartoons,\u201d she says as an after-thought, pointing to the Tweety bird which has been placed next to her photograph at the centre.\nSr. Mary received awards such as the Medal of the Order of Australia and Asialink Dunlop Medal.\nMITHRA was visited by Janette Howard, wife of former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, says Ms. Mahoney. \u201cWe are expecting close to 1,000 people to attend the service,\u201d she adds.

But, any act of omission or commission by the person after his appointment could not be made the subject matter of a Writ of Quo Warranto.\nPetitioner K.Bharathi\u2019s complaint was that an advertisement in a Tamil newspaper in its Madurai edition on November 21 this year carried a group photograph purportedly taken on the occasion of the wedding reception of Mr.Justice Vijayaraghavan\u2019s son. In the photograph were the Judge and his wife apart from the Chief Minister, the newly married couple and the bride\u2019s parents. At the bottom of the advertisement was a message of thanks to the Chief Minister for having blessed the couple. Also, the names of the Judge, his wife and the parents of the bride were printed. The message of thanks carried adulations to the Chief Minister.\nMr.Bharathi said Mr.Justice Vijayaraghavan, henceforth, would not be able to discharge his functions as a Judge in an unbiased manner. Once a Judge identified himself as a person belonging to a political party by issuing such advertisements, it would tarnish the image of the judiciary. People would lose faith in judiciary.\nThe Bench observed that the petitioner\u2019s contention was based only on presumptions and surmises. The petition proceeded on the presumption that the advertisement had actually been issued by Mr.Justice Vijayaraghavan.\n\u201cBut, we have no proof before us to show that the advertisement was actually issued either by the third respondent (the Judge) or at his behest.\u201d The petitioner, an advocate, had failed to make even a remote reference to the principles of judicial conduct that bound Judges morally.\nThe Code of Judicial Conduct, which had evolved over the years, had still not been given statutory force. Even if it was given such a status, the conduct of a Judge could be questioned only in different sets of proceedings, either under the provisions of such a statute (if it ever comes) or in impeachment proceedings, the Bench said.\n\n\nPetition stated judge could not function in unbiased manner\n\n\n\n\nBench says petition based on presumptions\n\n\n"

            "body": "Elephants said to be over 80 in number and in groups of five to six herds were on the rampage in various parts of Valparai leaving the plantation workers in fear.\nAccording to sources, owing to increased presence of pilgrims on the Kerala side of the Forests due to the Sabarimala Mahara Vilakku season, the elephants normally migrated either towards Meghamalai, Varusa Nadu, Munnar or Chinnar areas. But this year, the phenomenal increase in the number of herds and its size has led to the suspicion that there was an influx of elephants from the Kerala border towards Valparai.\nElephant herds were found in Periyakallar, Nallamudi, Poonjolai, Injiparai, Kurangumudi and Nallakathu areas. Only on Saturday last, an estate watchman was found trampled to death.\nOn Monday, a herd that tried to stray into UPASI Tea Research Institute plantation area resisted the efforts by plantation workers and watchman to chase them away. After people left the place to safety on seeing the herd marching ahead, the herd damaged the house and household articles there.\nThe other herds had already damaged the houses of plantation workers and Public Distribution System (PDS) outlets in other areas surrounding Valparai.\nIn the wake of the increasing number of herds and their size and problem of human-animal conflicts in various pockets of Valparai, the officials from Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) have deployed more number of forest staff, besides anti-depredation squad staff and anti-poaching watchers besides equipping the Quick Response Teams in a bid to mitigate the conflict situations.\n"

It would also give customers \u2018incredible speed that does not exist in the market today.\u2019 Highlighting the existing demand for 2G services even after the roll out of 3G services, he said 4G would co-exist with 2G and 3G. Because each segment had got its own users and each came at a differing cost and there would be demand for each segment.\nMaking it clear that the handsets in the market did not support 4G, he said it was not known whether the 4G handsets would support 2G and 3G services.\nMr. Sankara Narayanan said Aircel would like to focus on data services as there was tremendous scope for growth. For Aircel in the Rest of Tamil Nadu Circle, there were 26 lakh customers using data services out of the total subscriber base of 1.8 crore. In fact, the number of data users on mobile phones was growing at 100 per cent year on year, he added.\nAircel had 400 towers in Tamil Nadu and based on customer usage of data services, the numbers were being augmented. All the 6,200 towers in Rest of Tamil Nadu were 2G ready and plans were on to increase the number of 3G towers by another 400 in Rest of Tamil Nadu.\nAircel had to accelerate the growth of data segment since the modern handsets with a lot of data capabilities enabled the cellular phone users to access them and stay connected on all kinds of electronic platforms.\nTerming the data usage as a \u2018rage,\u2019 Mr.Sankara Narayanan justified the same by stating that revenue growth on voice calls was only 10 per cent while in data usage, it was a whopping 100 per cent in a year in Rest of Tamil Nadu Circle.

On the issue of solution to text message traffic and termination charges to other operators leading to disconnection of the SMS service of a few operators by other operators and how successfully and permanently it had been resolved, Mr. Sankara Narayanan said the SMS issue was \u2018not an Aircel issue, it was an industry issue.\u2019 The issue was before the court and the court had issued an interim order based on which reconnection was done and the services were normal, he said.\nHe declined to comment on reports about the Malaysia-based promoter of Aircel, holding majority stake in Aircel, planning to sell part of the stake to Russia\u2019s Sistema.\n"

Two basic tools available for this purpose are the Weather Radars and Meteorological Satellites.

But it is important to address the issue of human resource in this area so that they are trained to take up the challenging task of enhancing accuracy of weather forecasts.\u201d\nAviators had to live in harmony with weather elements and at the same time avoid all aviation weather hazards.

The GRH blood bank is expected to end up with 21,000 units of blood collection as another eight camps are to be conducted before the end of this year. Already 292 camps were conducted this year.\nTotally 20,354 units of blood have been collected this year \u2014 it was 16,144 units last year. \u201cThis is a record for both units and camps. Still, there is a huge requirement and we are on the lookout for more donors in Madurai to meet the emergency requirement of blood,\u201d Prabha Samiraj, Medical Officer, GRH blood bank, told The Hindu on Tuesday. She said that in the last two months people had volunteered to donate blood in view of dengue fever crisis since the patients required blood platelets and public message was sent out requesting for blood donors.\nBlood donation in GRH has been increasing gradually year after year. In 2010, the total blood collection was 14,803 units and this had increased to 16,144 units in 2011. This year, it has crossed the 20,000 mark. Last year, the number of camps conducted was 164 and this had risen to 292 till now this year.\n\u201cAwareness among the public about the importance of blood donation is increasing. Our camps are also getting a good response,\u201d she said. There is a yardstick to say whether a camp is successful or not. If the total number of units collected was 25 units or more in a single camp, then that blood donation camp is considered to be successful.\nThe blood bank statistics reveal that most of the camps were successful. This year, out of the total 292 camps held, 216 were successful. Last year, 166 out of 215 camps were successful.\nMost of the blood donation comes from college students. Last year, 80 per cent of blood donation was from colleges while the remaining 20 per cent was from the general public. \u201cThere is a mobile collecting vehicle also which is being positioned at important public places in the city to collect blood. Through this vehicle, 2,676 units were collected from January to November this year. Blood donation activity is yet to pick up in rural areas. We appeal to private companies, organisations and individuals to organise camps since the need for blood during surgeries is increasing,\u201d she said.\nThere was a scarcity of blood during college vacation time and at the time of examinations.\nBlood collected from donors was being stored in the well-equipped GRH blood bank. \u201cOne unit of blood can save three lives as the components can be used for different purposes. In GRH blood bank, there will be 35 donors per day on an average,\u201d she said. The importance of blood donation was stressed because fresh blood is required for heart surgery. Those who want to know more about blood donation camps can contact the blood bank on phone number 0452 2520950.\n"

But, when it came to voting, they supported the government. We do not know what the magic wand is. Some say it is the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and some say it\u2019s the Walmart,\u201d she said.\nShe pointed out that Walmart had announced that it had spent Rs. 125 crore to lobby for opening up the Indian market to global giants. \u201cThe DMK has set a new record in taking dual stand in the issue. Its MP T.K.S. Elangovan made point after point opposing the FDI in retail. But, at the end of his long speech, he said: We don\u2019t like your policy, but you (the Congress) being our brother, we will support you (your wrong policy)\u201d Ms. Brinda said.\nTaking a dig at the in-fighting among the brothers M.K. Alagiri and M.K. Stalin in the party affairs, she said, \u201cWhile the brothers were fighting for the chair (leadership in the party) in the State, the DMK fought to save the chair (its ministerial berths in the Centre),\u201d she said.\nMs. Karat, however, was appreciative of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and its leader Jayalalithaa for having opposed FDI in retail till the end of voting in Parliament.\nThe struggle against FDI in retail has not stopped with the voting in Parliament but will continue in all the 53 cities across the country where the Centre has allowed big global retailers to set up shop, Ms. Karat, said.\nShe assured the trade representatives that the Left parties would not allow the UPA government to sell the interests of the people in the name of economic reforms. \u201cWe will not allow global giants to bulldoze Indian retailers,\u201d she said.\nThe country had witnessed suicide of two lakh farmers because of the wrong economic policies of the Centre. Those families turned to retail trading to save themselves after having realised that agriculture would not be a profitable venture. \u201cBut the government is paving way for small traders also to commit suicide (by allowing FDI in retail),\u201d Ms. Karat said.\nThe government that had failed to generate employment to the youth and give farmers a commensurate price for their agricultural produce was claiming that the likes of Walmart would solve these two grave issues. She refuted the claims of the government that four crore jobs would be created by the giants through FDI in retail. Instead, every job created by the big global retailer would snatch 17 existing jobs, and every shop set up by them would throw hundreds of retail shops out of business.\nThe experience of even the European Union with the big global retailers had been that the farmers were forced to sell their produce to them at a rock bottom price through unrealistic specifications. \u201cWhile the sales at those giant retailers have come down in the last three years, their profits have grown,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe Centre that has failed to check the increasing price of essential commodities wants to hand over its market to the global retail players to bring down the prices,\u201d she said.\n"

TRAI pointed out that if the government controlled the distribution system, it could potentially dictate what people watched, leading to a kind of unofficial State censorship of television. The I&B Ministry had drafted a note based on TRAI\u2019s views, and circulated it to major stakeholders.\nWith a sharp spike in the number of applications for channels and cable operations from government bodies, the Ministry is examining the issue again. Its fresh request to TRAI is comprehensive, asking the regulatory body to explore whether government \u2013 State or Central -- ministries, departments, public sector undertakings (PSUs), government-owned companies, government-funded entities, or even joint ventures with the private sector can be permitted to enter the sector. \u201cThe ministry has received requests from the Central government ministry and from several State governments in the past,\u201d said an I&B statement on Tuesday.\nSoon after taking charge last month, Union Minister for I&B Manish Tiwari had initially seemed positive towards political involvement in the broadcasting sector. Asked for his view on whether political parties and leaders could own channels or cable distribution systems he said: \u201cThere has always been an organic linkage between political movements and instruments of information dissemination\u2026It continues to remain a fundamental freedom.\u201d\nHowever, secretary Uday Kumar Varma was quick to clarify that existing regulations do not allow State governments to own or operate a television channel.\nTamil Nadu\u2019s Arasu is an anomaly. Formed by the DMK government in the context of a family feud between then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and the Maran clan, it was meant to take on Sun TV and its Sumangali cable network. With the families patching up, the corporation was defunct, until the present Chief Minister Jayalalithaa revived it in her own bid to fight Sumangali\u2019s market dominance.\nHowever, Arasu\u2019s July 2012 application for a digital addressable system license \u2013 made mandatory under the new digitisation regime \u2013 is still pending. TRAI\u2019s new recommendations could thus be critical for Arasu\u2019s survival.\n\n\nTRAI said in 2008 governments may not be permitted to enter the field\n\n\n\n\nArasu\u2019s future depends on TRAI\u2019s new recommendation\n\n\n"

            "body": "The 35{+t}{+h}general body meeting of Perambalur Sugar Mills, a public sector unit, scheduled for Wednesday, is likely to be stormy with farmers determined to rake up the issue of diluting the shareholding of the public to just about five per cent from the original 46 per cent. Writing off of the penal interest of Rs.24.75 crore, which has been converted into the share of the government, and fixing Rs.3,000 a tonne as procurement price for sugarcane would be among the major demands.\nRajachidambaram, State general secretary of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangham, told The Hindu that a number of cane growers\u2019 associations and farmers\u2019 bodies have decided to oppose the \u201cdictatorial\u201d attitude of the management.\nN. P. Anbazhagan, secretary, Sugarcane Growers\u2019 Association, Perambalur, pointed out that farmers invested as much as Rs.1.94 crore in 1978 and thus had 46.41 per cent share in the mill while the State government had invested Rs.2.24 crore to hold 53.59 per cent share.\nA. Venugopal, Perambalur district president of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangham, said the mill was declared \u201csick\u201d on April 4, 2000, and referred to the Bureau of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction. As the management refused to heed the suggestion of the ITCOT to put the mill back on the rails, the interest burden kept piling up.\nMr.Rajachidambaram alleged that the management chose to convert that penal interest of Rs.24.75 crore, which was met by the loan from the State government, into share and thus \u201cthe government now has 94.23 per cent share in the mill whereas that of the farmers has shrunk to just about five per cent. We have been opposing this for the past three years.\u201d\nHe pleaded for restoring the situation prevailing before the conversion of the penal interest into share. \u201cAfter all, it is the government, which is the de facto management and is responsible for the losses. When the mill got loans at 17 per cent interest and failed to repay within the due date, it had attracted penal interest also.\u201d Hence, he appealed to the State government to write off the penal interest and thus restore the shareholding of the public.\nAnother major grievance is that cogeneration work at the mill is at standstill. Perambalur is one of the 12 mills where cogeneration was proposed. The total generation planned in the 12 mills was 183 MW for which Rs.849 crore was sanctioned in 2010.\n\u201cWhile work is going on in some mills, nothing is happening at Perambalur mill because of non-allocation of funds despite the arrival of the machinery,\u201d he alleged. \u201cWe have paid our share towards the project costing Rs.91crore. Similarly, the proposed modernisation works remained halfway through at the mill,\u201d he added.\nFarmers are furious over the decision to stop distribution of two kilograms of sugar to the shareholders at the general body meeting citing a Central government circular. \u201cWe have been getting sugar at the general body meeting for the past 15 years and we don\u2019t know why it should be stopped now.\u201d\nThey also propose to demand early payment of Rs.135 a tonne, which is the additional price for the cane suppliers of 2004-05 season.\n"

Kallipatti near Periyakulam town on Tuesday demanding the arrest of those responsible for the suicide of a Dalit priest and refused to accept the body for the fourth day.\nNagamuthu of Ambedkar Nagar committed suicide on Friday after he was harassed and subjected to caste discrimination by a group of influential persons in the town. His father N. Subburaj claimed that the Periyakulam Municipal Chairman, Thenkarai Town Panchayat Chairman and five others were responsible for his son\u2019s suicide.\nMr. Subburaj said that Nagamuthu was in an agitated mood for some months and wanted to expose the discrimination. He had left a suicide note in which he had named seven persons out of whom four belonged to the Scheduled Caste.\nThe authenticity of the note is being probed by the police.\nThe village president demanded that the persons responsible for the suicide be immediately arrested and government provide compensation of Rs.5 lakh along with a job to a member of the family.\nWhen asked about Dalits figuring in the suicide note he said they were victims of power relationship.\nIn view of the protest, bus services were suspended and shops remained closed in Periyakulam. Superintendents of Police of Theni and Dindigul districts tried to pacify the protesters, but in vain.\nAfter VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan spoke to the protesters from Chennai on phone, they withdrew the road roko. The VCK leader said that a hunger strike would be observed till the accused were arrested and they would not receive the body.\nTheni Superintendent of Police Praveen Kumar Abhinapu told The Hindu that, one of the persons named in the FIR, Manimaran, had surrendered before a Judicial Magistrate Court in Madurai and another, Gnanam, had been arrested. Asked about the arrest of others, he said a search was on.\nMr. Subburaj said his son became the priest of the temple, which had been left unattended for several years. Nagamuthu made the temple popular by inviting the villagers to offer worship. After a few years, the temple was renovated and consecration done, leading to an increase in the number of devotees. Many caste groups, including Scheduled Castes, started claiming its ownership.\nAndiappan, T. Kallipatti panchayat president, said the temple committee in April had asked Nagamuthu in April to keep off on auspicious occasions and festival times. He was assaulted when he objected. He could get a police case filed only after the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court gave a direction on August 31.\nThe Thenkarai police filed cases under Sections 294(b), 323, 506(1) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3(1)(x) of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989.\n"

The project will be supported by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.\nThis will be the first project in the country for a solar powered university campus under the MNRE scheme, co-prinicipal investigator of the project G. Poyyamoli told The Hindu on Tuesday.\nAfter an initial survey of the area along with consultant Dwipen Boruah, it has been determined that if all the rooftops (including the car parks and bike parks) on the Silver Jubilee Campus had solar panels and a separate solar ring was installed in the central lawn space, it was possible to generate 1MW of power.\nMNRE would potentially fund 30 per cent of the project, Mr. Boruah said.\nThe MNRE was currently giving the University Rs. 10 lakh to prepare the Master Plan and the Detailed Project Report.\nThey were also considering small wind turbines on the periphery of the Campus, for which they would get a 50 per cent subsidy.\nThe 1 MW solar power potential would generate around 1,570 Megawatt hours of power per year, which was more than the requirement of the Silver Jubilee Campus. Any excess power that was generated could be given to the general grid.\nOne of the main issues of solar energy is that it is only available during the day.\nThis is when there was peak usage in the industrial area, so by giving any excess power generated during the day to the general grid, they would be helping the community.\nAlso, at night when there was no power generated from the solar panels, they could receive power from the grid, he said.\nAccording to principal investigator on the project R. Arun Prasath, the proposal that was submitted to the MNRE also included two 100 cc biogas plants and solar steam cookers.\nThe Dean of the Madanjeet Singh Centre of Green Energy Technology H.S.P. Rao said that the University was separately working on a prototype solar energy project by providing rooftop solar panels to the newly constructed Controller of Examination office as well as the main office.\n"

While standalone lights are installed in remote and isolated villages, new lights in rows of 10 are being installed in villages faced with problems of voltage fluctuations. The third category involves conversion of existing streetlights into solar-powered ones, also in rows of 10 lights. For such row lighting, 500 watt solar power storage units would be established at a common place.\nDistrict officials point out that the solar-powered streetlights have come in handy for students to read under them even during power cuts.\nThe solar-powered lights are also monitored through remote units thereby ensuring their proper operation.\n"

Though the waste produced from reactors is minimal, it will be highly radioactive. However, safety measures incorporated in reactors will not allow the radiation to be transmitted from the reactor core, the official said.\nSince the KKNPP had been constructed with 7-tier safety arrangements, there was no chance of radiation getting transmitted from the reactors to the atmosphere.\nTo ensure there was no significant rise in terrestrial radiation in villages around the site once the reactors became operational, the NPCIL conducted a pre-operational survey in every village under Radhapuram taluk in the district in the last quarter of 2006 to prepare a baseline data on natural background radiation. The KKNPP administration had also proposed to establish an information centre to clarify doubts regarding the ready-to-be commissioned nuclear power project and apprehensions about radiation and safety measures.\n"

There were 21 officers in the In-service Course, comprising 11 from Tamil Nadu, one from Karnataka and nine from Kerala.\nAmong the 21 officers, three were recipients of the Chief Minister\u2019s Medal for good service and one recipient of the Anna medal for gallantry.\nThe officers were given training in indoor and outdoor subjects and taken on a study tour across India to learn the best prison practices.

If you have a smartphone, just download the Kutcheris app and you can have your own personalised calendar. \u201cThere are nearly 3,000 concerts held across the city during the music season. There is a wealth of information available but it is scattered across the web. We have tried to organise relevant information and make it easily accessible for people,\u201d says Vikram K. Raghavan, a vocalist. The driving force behind kutcheris.com is a team that comprises Vikram, R. Ramkumar, a management professional, and students Madhav Rajan, Gayathri Mani and Vidhya Raghavan. With Ram being a mridangam player and Gayathri, Vidhya and Vikram, vocalists, the team has found an interesting way to make artistes and their performances accessible. Madhav, a final-year student at Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering, has been handling the technical side of the app. It was Carnatic musician T.M. Krishna who first proposed the idea of having a site for the music season in 2009, say the team members. With his support, a few artistes came together and launched the DecemberSeason.com then.\nThe initiative grew into a website that offered information about music events not only in Chennai but across the world. It now provides information on artistes, organisations and events to viewers in nearly 50 countries.\n\u201cWhen you see people in the Netherlands sharing our links with people in Chennai, you realise the kind of reach it has,\u201d says Vidhya, who studies biotechnology in Anna University. The app provides an easy interface to the user wherein she can either browse by artistes, organisations or venues, filter out the type of event \u2014 drama, lecture demonstration or Carnatic concert \u2014 or view the entire list of events. A Google map opens up as soon as she clicks a venue, providing location details. \u201cPeople may go to concerts to listen to their favourite accompanying artistes, but may not find their names in print listings. In the app, we try to give you details about all the performers,\u201d says Ram. It is a boon for people who need to plan their schedules in advance, which is not possible if you depend on the newspaper listings, he adds.\n\u201cWhen I was in Bangalore, I wanted to take two weeks off from work to attend concerts in Chennai. But it was so difficult to plan. A personalised calendar means a lot during such situations,\u201d he adds.\n\nConstant updates\n\nArtistes send in their schedules as do the sabha officials and the teams tries to keep the listings constantly updated. Besides, the website has a list of lodging facilities and eateries to aid visitors in the city during the season.\nLinks to music videos and expanded articles are also on display and the user can choose to get regular alerts from artistes. \u201cI see many of my friends willing to know about concerts now because the information is easily accessible, on their phones,\u201d says Gayathri.\nWith over 2,000 likes for their Facebook page, Madhav says, the response to the kutcheris mobile app has been very positive and growing each day. The team is working on features that will allow artistes and organisers to better manage their content and connect with the artiste community throughout the year. \u201cOur aim is to bring together artistes, organisers, and rasikas into a single online community. We have IMDB for movies and Cricinfo for cricket, why not something for our own music festival?\u201d says Vikram.\n"

With 24 coastal villages across the district, around 19,500 fishermen were being actively engaged in fishing.\nBesides, second phase of enrolment is on to extend similar facility to the rest of the fishermen.

With Lord Shanmukha mount on its back, they set sail to Kailasam to meet Lord Shiva. Opening her performance with the traditional \u2018 Shanmukha Kauttuvam \u2019 , Nrithya Pillai sizzled and dazzled from the word go. Set to Shanmukhapriya and Mohanam, interspersed with the Chatushra Alarippu, with powerful nattuvangam by Jayashri Ramnath and some excellent flute by Devaraj, the opening was thoroughly enjoyable.\nFollowing that with \u2018 Manavi chekona raada\u2019 a traditional Tanjore quartet varnam set to Shankarabharanam with liberal jatis choreographed by Ramaiah Pillai, \u201cWe do it different in our style,\u201d Nrithya announced with an air of pride before she began. It couldn\u2019t have been better placed coming from the great grand-daughter of Vazhuvoor Ramaiah Pillai and grand-daughter of Swamimalai Rajarathnam Pillai. While her n ritta sequences were well-timed with clear lines and arresting teermanams , Nrithya could have been better in her abhinaya . Repetitive sancharis added to her hunched shoulders and an unknown haste seemed to limit her performance. The nayika \u2019s pining for Lord Brihadeeshwara was satisfactory at best.\nIf Roshni Ganesh had got the sahityam right with her beautiful voice, Lord Brihadeeshwara would have voluntarily arrived at the nayika\u2019s appeal. She lingered on \u2018 Panta milara\u2019 for long, not realising her mispronunciation and the Lord didn\u2019t seem enough pleased. At one point the mridangam player seemed to fall asleep.\nAfter an unimpressive attempt at an Annamayya keertana and a Kannada javali , Nrithya went ahead to perform a tillana composed by Samu Nattuvanar, the grandfather of Ramaiah Pillai. Legend goes that the nattuvanar composed this overnight in the honour of Chamarajendra Wodeyar of Mysore. Bright and vivacious, Nrithya bounced back to her true self that had simmered in the two earlier pieces. Nrithya has an enviable lineage to flaunt, an excellent stage presence and a distinct style of her own, unlike many other youngsters of the Vazhuvoor bani . If she can polish her act, she could easily be one of the big names to look forward to in the coming years.\n( Veejay Sai is a writer, editor and culture critic. )\n"

The third priority, in his opinion, should be construction of a ropeway to transport material between Pampa and the Sannidhanam. The double-storey Valiya Nadappanthal project is likely to materialise only later. The HPC has decided to construct the Nadappanthal before the next pilgrim season with a view to easing crowding at the Sannidhanam. Two construction majors, Larson and Toubro and the Hyderabad-based Ramky, have reportedly qualified the technical bid for the Valiya Nadappanthal project. Though Ramky had submitted the entire documents demanded by the HPC, L&T was yet to carry out the vetting of their project report by a competent agency, according to official sources.

His concert on Monday at the Mylapore Fine Arts Club was certainly very pleasing to the ear. Also, his geniality and rapport with senior accompanists Vittal Ramamurthy (violin) and J. Vaidhyanathan (mridangam) as well as young kanjira artiste B. Shree Sundarkumar, made for a wholesome kutcheri experience. These redeeming aspects should be considered by those inclined to sulk at the overall lightness of the fare or the fairly long tukkada phase.\nThe concert started with Dikshitar\u2019s Siddhi Vinayakam in Chamaram sung at a stately pace, arguably the composer\u2019s intent; however, the experience was slightly marred by certain types of frivolous sangati s that do not gel well with the Dikshitar ethos. This was followed by a brisk Kumaran Taal Paninde Tudi in Yadukulakambhoji by Papanasam Sivan. There was a brief but thrilling exchange of swara s.\nVarali was taken up as the sub-main item. Sriram sang a superb alapana that was a good balance of brikka s, slow oscillations and even an exploration of the plain notes, ma and ni . Vittal Ramamurthy showed his experience and class by keeping his alapana brief and aesthetic. His accompaniment throughout the concert was chaste and understated. The Dikshitar classic Maamava Meenakshi in Mishra Chapu was rendered. Next up, a rapid-fire Sarasa Samadana (Kapinarayani) of Tyagaraja was punctuated by some scintillating mel-kala neraval at the lyric hitavu matalento , before taking up the main item, a ragam tanam pallavi in Mohanam.\nSriram\u2019s Mohanam alapana , overall rendered excellently, started off in a genre-bending Carnatic-Hindustani fashion. Vittal Ramamurthy followed with a brief essay and a tanam . The pallavi was rhythmically straightforward, in Adi tala , but was coloured by pleasing slow speed ragamalika swara s in Hamirkalyani, Dhanyasi, Hamsanandi, and a brief Chenchuruti, before returning to Mohanam. Interestingly, trikalam was rendered after the ragamalika swaram s, and this was followed by a brief and superb tani , showcasing the tishra nadai . The impeccably professional J. Vaidhyanathan\u2019s accompaniment was superb and shone in practically every department. B. Shree Sundarkumar managed to generate an unusually deep and rich tone on the kanjira and added some thrilling moments, notably during Kapinarayani as well as the tani .\nThe half hour that followed saw a light and melodious series of tukkadas \u2014 in Jhonpuri, a tillana in Behag and a viruttam in Hamsanandi, Kedaragowla and Desh, and Tanjavur Shankara Iyer\u2019s Ramanama . The concert was rounded off with Vangakadal in Suruti.\nIt may be mentioned in passing that there was a perception of a slight shortfall in the swarasthana when Sriram held the long notes at the upper sa with his mouth partially closed, although the tone was warm and rich. Similarly, on occasion there was the perception that Vittal Ramamurthy\u2019s was a little elevated. As is the unfortunate practice in most Carnatic concerts, the tambura was entirely inaudible to the audience and hence it was hard to tell where the problem was.\n\n(Uday Shankar is a biomedical design engineer by profession; udayshankar10@gmail.com)\n"

Let the PWD inform the public in which quarries they, along with the loading contractor, allow direct purchase of sand through PWD permits. That being the case, it is laughable that the State government is feigning to rein in the sand price knowing full well the reason for the exorbitant price, they allege. \u201cThe PWD must sell sand at source at the rate of Rs.315 per unit. But only in a couple of sand quarries in Thanjavur district the rule is in vogue and in quarries in Tiruchi, Perambalur, Ariyalur and Thanjavur districts the loading contractor sells sand at an exorbitant price of Rs.4,000 per three units. In Karur and Erode district quarries, besides a couple of quarries in Tiruchi district, the price is Rs.4,500 per truck load of three units. Now tell us who is the reason behind the high sand cost? How the sand price will come down benefitting the consumer if the PWD itself is the culprit?\u201d asks Sella Rajamani, president of the Sand Lorry Owners\u2019 Federation of Tamil Nadu.\nThe truckers are sore that they are being vilified for the prevailing high sand price. \u201cWe are getting loads, at the loading contractor fixed rate, once in two or three days. Simply calculate our investment cost, operation cost and incidental charges and finally we get Rs.1,500 per load for a travel of more than 350 kilometres from the quarry to the destination and that too once in two days.\nCost of spares, fuel, tyres, driver/cleaner bata, all have risen over the years but we are at the mercy of the loading contractor who has been allowed to monopoly of sand sale. We had to grin and bear but when the PWD and the private player turned the table on us for the rising sand cost we had no option but to come out with the truth,\u201d say other office-bearers of the Federation.\nThere are more than 70,000 trucks involved exclusively in sand transportation and sales all over the State.\n"

            "body": "The date December 12, 2012 (12-12-12) is something great and unique in all aspects. Research studies reveal that no significant historical event or events occurred one thousand years ago in the year 1012. Similarly, no specific historical events happened two thousand years ago in the year 12. Mayan\u2019s long-count calendar that began 5,126 years ago ends in 2012. It is also revealed that the dark ages spread over 450 to 1450 years between 5th and 15th centuries.\n\nNumber 12 is unique\nThe number 12 is a unique, useful and interesting number. Scientists, mathematicians and the society by and large recognise the number from the beginning of human history. The usefulness of the number 12 derives from its divisibility and a few small numbers that can be evenly divided into so many subsets.\nThe number 12 can be evenly divided into halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, and twelfths. Multiples of 12, by definition, retain this divisibility. The number 12, and its multiples are so well-knit into our society and being used everywhere for our time logistics.\n\nThe 12 Month Calendar\nHistorical evidences show that Egyptians came up with the first 12 month calendar and was later modified by the Romans who retained the 12 month format.\nBoth cultures had abandoned any attempt to match the calendar with the lunar cycle but all emphasis was placed on the solar cycle. The uniqueness of 12 months being evenly divisible into quarters and halves has been in use from time immemorial.\n\nUniqueness of Zodiac\nThe uniqueness of the zodiac is the synchronisation and mapping of space and time and accomplished by dividing the ecliptic into 12 zones and each zone equaling 30 degrees of the 360 degree universe.\nAstronomers use the zodiac as the main tool most of the common people who are familiar with astrology knew about the use of 12 signs of the zodiac.\n\nRole of Number 12 in games\nRoulette, one of the most popular casino games from low rollers to high rollers, loves the number 36 (3 x 12). It makes for a nice, long 3-number by 12-number table that lots of players can gather around.\nThe rampant divisibility of this number enables players to get themselves in trouble in all sorts of ways, especially when that pesky zero or zero-zero drops by. Players can bet on groups of 1,2,3,4,6,12, and 18 numbers in a multitude of combinations.\nIn the `Dice\u2019 game, the number 36 (3 x 12) = (6 x 6)) along with its inherent attributes, is an integral number In which You have 2 cubes with 6 sides each, enabling the existence of 11 numbers via a 6 x 6 matrix of 36 combinations.\nThe integration part comes in where as the probability of any particular combination of dice numbers showing is a direct function of the 6 x 6 matrix, according to experts who play Dice game.\n"

            "body": "The popular image of Subramania Bharati (1882-1921) is that of a great nationalist who relentlessly carried forward the cause of freedom struggle essentially through his writings. But, what is often overlooked is that Bharati was a great musicologist, a great advocate of music of different forms and, of course, a great connoisseur.\nHe did not undergo any formal training in music. Just as he acquired knowledge of different languages through his efforts, he also taught himself the nuances of music. Not contented with setting tunes and rhythms for many of his songs, he also prescribed the kind of emotion or rasa with which singers ought to sing his works. \nBharati\u2019s view of the world of music was not narrow or conventional. He did not confine himself to possessing knowledge over music. He observed classical musicians critically; studied the pros and cons of the utility of various musical instruments and commented upon the relationship between the general public and music. In his essay titled Sangeeta Vishayam (musical matters), he came down heavily on those who sang with false voice and on those who kept repeating the same combination of songs. He even compared Carnatic vocalists with Hindustani singers. His conclusion, perhaps unpalatable to some, was that Carnatic musicians did not subject themselves to rigorous practice.\n\u201cHe was for folk songs too. At the same time, he was conscious of inadequacies in this form of music and wanted the weak spots to be addressed so that the form was put on a stronger pedestal,\u201d says Amshan Kumar, a filmmaker and one of whose works was on Bharati. Echoing Amshan\u2019s viewpoint, Pe. Su. Mani, who authored several books on the contemporary history of Tamil Nadu, says Bharati had even argued that folk songs should form part of music concerts. \nAmshan goes on to add that Bharati\u2019s devotion to music was so much that he titled his first publication Swadesha Geetangal (1907) or songs of nationalism. This published work contained three songs.\nOften, Bharati\u2019s patriotic songs have received wider attention. But, there are other songs, particularly Kannan paattu (Krishna songs), that stand as a testimony to his lasting contribution to modern Tamil literature. In respect of Kannan paattu , wherein the poet visualised Lord Krishna as a friend, servant, teacher, child and the lover, he had set ragas, talas, besides laying down rasas.\nPointing out that Bharati\u2019s years in Puducherry (1908-1918) [wherein he stayed away himself from the nationalist movement] witnessed the creation of many of his acclaimed works, Seeni Viswanathan, veteran Bharati scholar and author of numerous books on Bharati, says that it was during this phase that Kannan paattu was published. \nIt is now acknowledged among students of history that Bharati may not have attained the level of eminence but for his musical impulse. He knew that for his songs to be rendered by musicians, he should employ a simple language. Only then would his message, particularly on the spirit of freedom, reach a greater audience. \n\n(ramakrishnan.t@\n\nthehindu.co.in)\n"

Often, companies formed cartels to lower the price of agro-forestry produce. This was true of the paper industry.\nIn India, around 32 million acres of forest was found around farmers fields. Therefore, the integration of Van Vigyan Kendra and Krishi Vigyan Kendra would help to improve food security, water security and even facilitate better technology to reach farmers.\nThis year, the Minister for Environment and Forest Jayanthi Natrajan announced in Coimbatore that they would distribute one crore free seedlings in areas affected by Cyclone Thane.\nThis was the first time the ICFRE was interacting with farmers to ascertain their needs. Earlier, they would distribute the seedlings through the Forest Department. The programme would start with farmers from Puducherry, Cuddalore and Villupuram, and will extend it to the other parts of the country.\nAt the function, Director of Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding N. Krishnakumar said 33 per cent of India should be forest area. So, in each district there was a move to improve the forest cover. There are over 600 companies selling agricultural seeds in India. There should be a move to start community seed orchards in many areas to improve agro-forestry. Around 145 trees having domestic value should be cultivated extensively to improve forest cover and to provide income. There was also a need for decentralised orchards to cater to the requirements of industries. They are currently working with the Indian Paper Manufacturing Association to provide good seeds, he said.\nAt the function, 100 farmers were given casuarina seedlings. The ICFRE is an autonomous organisation of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. It has established a Van Vigyan Kendra (Forest Science Centre) to disseminate technologies and technology products related to cultivation and management of important tree species.\n\n\nOfficials give tips to farmers in promoting\n\n\n\n\nagro-forestry\n\n\n"

He stopped short, and it wasn\u2019t one of those pregnant pauses that expert vocalists employ to accentuate the beauty of the musical phrase. It was a nonplussed silence.

The bribe was renegotiated to Rs.20,000 and it was agreed that it would be paid at Ms. Awwai\u2019s house at Sudhamanagar.\nBut Mr. Channegowda had had enough of this harassment and approached the Lokayukta police who in turn trapped Ms. Awwai while she was accepting Rs.15,000 of the Rs.20,000 she had demanded.\nThe arrest of the Congress councillor sent the media into a tizzy as they camped outside her residence for nearly five hours while she was being interrogated by the Lokayukta police.\nIn the other case, tax collector (Bytrayanapura Division) Chandrashekharaiah was caught by the Lokayukta while accepting a bribe of Rs.10,000 at his office. The complainant, Muniraju, had told the Lokayukta police that the BBMP official was demanding the bribe to reduce his tax liability on a piece of land.\n"

Udasi and his son Shivakumar C. Udasi [Lok Sabha member],\u201d Mr. Kalahalli alleged.\nHe alleged that the ill-gotten wealth was invested by the Udasis into the Rasi group of companies owned by them.\nHe produced documents showing that in the last three years each one of the sanctioned projects was intentionally kept at less than Rs. 20 lakh to duck the e-procurement mandate.\n\u201ce-procurement becomes mandatory for projects worth more than Rs. 20 lakh. By keeping the individual projects at less than Rs. 20 lakh, they could go in for manual tendering by placing advertisements in newspapers,\u201d he said while producing a list of the advertisements.\nThe advertisements, produced by Mr. Kalahalli, showed that tender notices for projects in south Karnataka had been put up in newspapers in North Karnataka.\n\u201cThis was done to prevent competitive bidding by contractors. Instead, those contractors who were close to the Minister and his son were the ones who submitted their quotations and were awarded the projects,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAlthough I have not conducted a comprehensive study, the same pattern of tendering was followed in different parts of the State,\u201d Mr. Kalahalli said.\nAnother interesting facet of Mr. Kalahalli\u2019s RTI-based investigation is multiple sanctions for the same road.\nHe explained, \u201cLet us assume a road laying project has been sanctioned between Anil Kumble Circle and Cubbon Park entrance. The scamsters would make another entry saying \u2018road laying work between LIC building and Queen\u2019s Statue\u2019.

Jayaram Chouta alleged that Airtel\u2019s recovery agents threatened and abused his family and spread rumours about his death.\nMr. Chouta, who was a judge in the High Courts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and headed the State Consumer Redressal Commission, alleged that his son Sandesh J. Chouta, a practising advocate in Karnataka High Court for the past 15 years, got an Airtel connection 10 years ago.\nHe also obtained an add-on connection which was in use for some time. When he received an arbitrary bill of Rs. 50,000, he disconnected the service and moved the consumer court.\nThe case is pending before the II Additional District Consumer Redressal Forum in Bangalore.\nMeanwhile, the recovery agents started calling the younger Chouta and demanded payment. He initially ignored the calls but they allegedly started threatening him with dire consequences.\n\nThe \u2018road accident\u2019\n\nMatters came to a head when the Airtel staff called the retired judge\u2019s home and told the family he had been hospitalised following a road accident.\nThis triggered panic particularly as the caller had got hold of his wife\u2019s number.\nOne agent, identifying himself as Arjun Vishwanath, called up a relative of Mr. Jayaram Chouta in Puttur informing them that he had died in a road accident, the complaint stated. Anxious relatives called up the Chouta residence to convey their condolences and realised it was a hoax call.\n\nAbusive language\n\nAccording to the complaint, the agent then called another relative in Mumbai telling them that Mr. Jayaram Chouta had died. The caller even started calling family members and used abusive language, the complaint said, alleging there was no doubt the calls were made at the insistence of the company\u2019s chief executive officer and other senior staff.\nBased on the complaint, the Sanjaynagar police registered a case against Airtel\u2019s managing director and chief executive officer and against its recovery department under Section 66 (A) of the Information Technology Act.

As the bill had been due since many months, the recovery staff were contacting him to get the payment. When Mr. Chouta started avoiding the calls, the staff had tried alternative numbers provided by him.\nThe company did not know that the add-on number was with Mr. Chouta\u2019s father. Enquiries with the staff concerned revealed that they have not misbehaved with the client in any way, the spokesperson added.\n"

As chairman of the advisory board of the ESI Hospital in Rajajinagar, and as member, National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, I heard a number of cases of alleged medical negligence. (In that role), you hear cases and you have to write the judgment and I have delivered judgments extracts of which are present in the book.\n\nWhat do you think of Savitha Halappanavar\u2019s case?\nLaw is an inanimate subject but interpreters are live, they have to interpret it with sympathy, empathy and humanity. Law has to protect human life. This is my personal opinion.\n\nYou have had a long and varied career in bureaucracy. Is there any event you remember in particular?\nAs Labour Secretary, I handled the largest number of strikes and averted them. I handled a strike by six lakh coal workers of Coal India Limited in 2002. The workmen were represented by five federations affiliated to CITU, AITUC, INTUC, BMS and HMS. A secretary or minister may mediate and they accepted my mediation. The mediation saved the country Rs. 485 crore and 42 lakh mandays. I got the support of trade union leaders and enlightened managements.\n"

            "body": "Registering an impressive recovery in its performance after a slowdown last fiscal year, the Mysore Division of the South Western Railway (SWR) has accrued a 19 per cent growth in its overall earnings between April and November.\nAs against Rs. 315.72 crore earned during April\u2013November last financial year, the division clocked Rs. 375.53 crore during the same period in 2012-13. The bulk of its earnings has come from freight transportation through which the division has earned Rs. 257.17 crore between April and November against Rs. 203.97 crore in the same period last year.\nAnup Dayanand Sadhu, Senior Divisional Commercial Manager, Mysore Division of SWR, told The Hindu the bulk of the freight comprised iron, foodgrains and cement \u2014 most of which originates from Chitradurga and ferried to Jindal Steel Plant \u2014 apart from sundry items. Though the ban on iron ore exports hit the Railways\u2019 performance last year, the division made good the loss through domestic movement consequent to commencement of mining at a few places, he added.\n\nPassenger handling\n\nPassenger transportation was the second largest revenue contributor and the division earned Rs. 101.75 crore till November-end in the current financial year against Rs. 96.8 crore during the corresponding period last year. This is a marginal jump of 5 per cent over the previous year\u2019s earnings. Mr. Sadhu opined that the growth could have been more substantial if not for the Cauvery agitation which resulted in disruption of train services and less patronisation by commuters during the agitation period, especially on the Mysore-Bangalore section.\nNot withstanding the minor disruption during the agitation period, the division registered a slight increase in the number of passengers handled. As against 34.98 million passengers carried during April-November last year, the division handled 35.69 million passengers during the same period this year.\n\nTrack-doubling\n\nExpressing confidence of registering impressive growth in revenue generation through passenger traffic, Mr. Sadhu pointed out that the completion of track-doubling between Birur and Arsikere had not only helped decongest the track but was also expected to generate additional passenger traffic and revenue as more trains could be run in future.\nThe division netted Rs. 6.46 crore under \u2018Other Coaching Earnings\u2019 and a drive against ticketless travelling added Rs. 2.27 crore to the revenue from April to November against Rs. 1.67 crore earned during the same period last year. Likewise, sundry earnings, including publicity, catering and operating special trains, helped accrue Rs. 10.15 crore by way of revenue against Rs. 8.76 crore last year.\nThe thrust on publicity to augment revenue led the railway authorities to tap the current trends in marketing and they introduced vinyl wrapping of the coaches to promote commercial products for a fee. The rakes of the Chamundi Express are vinyl wrapped to advertise products instead of its conventional livery. \u201cIn all, 63 coaches comprising the rakes of important trains originating from Mysore will be vinyl wrapped as tenders have been finalised. The revenue earned will be reflected during the last quarter,\u201d Mr. Sadhu said.\n\n\nThe division earned Rs. 375.53 crore during April\u2013November\n\n\n\n\nThe division handled 35.69 million passengers during the period against 34.98 million last year\n\n\n"

The autonagars would be set up at least 5 to 6 km away from the city limits, it had stated.\nMr. Urs said all four autonagars would be within 5 km from the Mysore Palace.\nThe project is expected to rid the city of a number of automobile workshops which have even encroached roads and footpaths. Vehicle spare part stalls, garages for repairs of automobiles, stalls for tyres, wheel alignments, tinkering and painting works and other overhaul works will be set up at the autonagars. Vehicles needed for towing vehicles from any spot in the city will be available there. Works relating to converting old and condemned vehicles into scrap can also be taken up there. Works such as seating and upholstery too will be carried out.

The class on reproductive health should be handled by a gynaecologist and that on mental health by a psychiatrist and the third on physical health by a general physician. The coordinators are finding it difficult to get the services of a gynaecologist and psychiatrist.\nDistrict coordinator, Career Guidance and Adolescent Counselling Cell, A.

The spot price of the Matta variety was Rs.19 a kg in the open market at Meenangadi on Tuesday but, the Supplyco was procuring it at Rs.17 a kg. When the \u2018Nanja\u2019 harvest had started by the middle of November, the open market price was Rs.10 to Rs.12 a kg and within a few weeks it went up to Rs.19 a kg, an all-time high price for the crop.\nThe Agriculture Department has been anticipating a production of 33,897.7 tonnes paddy from 10,271.9 hectares in the district during the season. But the Supplyco could procure only 15 tonnes so far as against 2,250 tonnes during the Punja season this year. However, the small-scale traders procured nearly 30 tonnes of paddy on Tuesday itself, Agriculture marketing sources said.\nAs many as 1,750 farmers have registered online to supply paddy at MSP rate to the Supplyco through Krishi Bhavans before the harvest. \u201cWe have expected a record procurement this season but, now we are in a tight position to deal with the unexpected situation,\u201d M.K. Promod, District Paddy Marketing Officer, told The Hindu . Supplyco had entered into a contract with three rice mills at Koduvally (in Kozhikode), Palakkad, and Kalady to process the produce procured from the district. The government had collected a security deposit of Rs.1 crore each from the mills for the purpose, he said.\nPayment\nIt was reported that the rice mill lobby had paid Rs.50 lakh to the small-scale traders to procure paddy at a higher price to torpedo the paddy procurement project of the Supplyco. If the lobby procured paddy at Rs.20 a kg, they would get a huge profit from the business as now they were selling branded rice varieties at Rs.45 a kg, a marketing source said.\n\u201cA drastic fall in the production of the crop in the neighbouring States shot up the price of the produce in three weeks,\u201d K. Ibrahim, a paddy trader at Meenangadi, said. The arrival of the product from the major paddy-growing States such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to the rice mills in Kalady and Palakkad was thin owing to a sharp fall in production, he added.\nNot only the prices but also the formalities of the Supplyco are deterring the farmers from selling their produce to the agency, said Gopi Keezhanikkal, president of the Arumad - Murani Padashekharam under Meenangadi Krishi Bhavan. \u201cMost of the farmers prefer to sell their produce to the government agency, though the price was comparatively low, but, we have to wait one to three months to get the price from the agency,\u201d he added.\n"

It is too narrow for me to hold up an umbrella as the vehicles passing by brush it aside,\u201d he said, while balancing precariously on the narrow ledge of the concrete fencing of the bridge.\nResidents of an apartment complex on the eastern end of the bridge have even tied up with a few autorickshaw drivers to take them to Pettah Junction hardly 100 m away just to evade the hardship of crossing the bridge.\n\u201cCars and buses often overtake on the bridge, though it is supposed to be banned on such a narrow bridge. This is a strategically located bridge connecting people with the city.

This is just the first step and there is a long way to go. But even this is an achievement, especially because I am featured along with composers like Hans Zimmer whom I have always admired,\u201d Sreevalsan Menon told The Hindu on Tuesday.\nThe film Saint Dracula is a new-age interpretation of the Bram Stoker story. \u201cThough there have been more than 200 films based on the story, this will perhaps be the second one belonging to the genre of drama and love story and not horror. It is extremely hard to do a drama, in tune with the Indian aesthetics, in Hollywood.

There are five or six recurring motifs, in one of which I have used Sarangi,\u201d said Sreevalsan Menon, who has already earned a position among leading Carnatic vocalists.\nThis is his fourth work as composer of original score for films and second with Rupesh Paul.\n\u201cWhile working on the music for this film, I definitely had the anxiety of influence. Mostly because some of my favourite music scores were from old Dracula films such as Love Never Dies . My challenge was to match them,\u201d he said.\nSreevalsan Menon has also composed music for the two English songs featured in this film. It will be another fortnight before he and Rupesh Paul can know if it has been included on the long list.\nExplaining the selection process, a communication from the publicity office of the Academy Awards that Sreevalsan Menon received said that a reminder list of works will be given along with the nominations ballot to all members in the music branch. Top five entries winning the most votes will be selected as nominations for the final voting for the award.\nThe 85th Academy Awards nominations will be announced on January 10, in the Academy\u2019s Samuel Goldwyn Theatre and the Academy Awards for outstanding film achievements of 2012 will be presented on Oscar Sunday, which is on February 24, at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood and Highland Centre. \n\n\nA pleasant New Year gift for the Carnatic musician as his score for Saint Dracula is in contention for the final nominations.\n\n\n"

The move has been criticised as anti-secular and anti-scientific as well as promoting superstitions.\nMr. Babu had said at a meeting of a community of traditional astrologers here on Sunday that the government planned to start astrology courses at the college level.\n\u201cAstrology is a false science,\u201d said Sreeni Pattathanam, general secretary of the Bharateeya Yuktivadi Sanghom, in reaction to the Minister\u2019s statement. \u201cAstrology is masquerading as science with the help religion and superstitions.\u201d\nHe said that astrology had been considered a science until the 16{+t}{+h}century \u2014 before the use of telescope by Galileo Galilei. The telescope disproved the earth-centred view of the universe and established the existence of the solar system. In the solar system, earth and other planets revolve around the sun as against the astrologers\u2019 belief that the sun revolves around earth.\n\n\u2018Cheating people\u2019\n\nAstrologers still considered earth to be the centre of the universe and the sun as a star and propagated the superstition that the movements of planets determined human affairs on the earth. Astrologers were cheating people by exploiting their ignorance and superstitious beliefs. By offering to start astrology courses, the Minister was colluding in this, Mr. Pattathanam alleged.\nP.R. Shaji, secretary of the Kochi-based Yuktiwadi Patana Kendram (Rationalism Study Centre) said the Minister was offering governmental support to showcase an \u2018unscientific, false science\u2019 as a branch of science.\nHe said that Jyothisham was a bunch of Hindu superstitions and that by offering to start courses in Jyothisham, the Minister was violating the secular and scientific spirit\u2019 of the Constitution.\n\u201cThe move is dangerous as it will promote communalism in society and instil fear in the minds of people,\u201d he said.

Pouran, State president of the People\u2019s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), told The Hindu . The scientific community had never accepted astrology as scientific truth. He said Jyothisham was now being used as a tool of the Hindutva ideology. \u201cJyothisham has no scientific basis, it is against secular values and by offering to start courses, the Minister is violating the spirit of the Constitution,\u201d he said.\nThe Breakthrough Science Society condemned the Minister\u2019s effort to give official sanctity to astrology at its special meeting here on Monday. \u201cStarting astrology courses at the university level will mean upstaging the secular and scientific values of modern Indian education which were formed through the constant efforts of great minds from the days of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar,\u201d the society said in a statement.\n\u201cIt has been proved beyond doubt that Jyothisham is not a science. It is entwined with the religious beliefs of a particular community. Any move to dress it up as science will have serious after-effects,\u201d the society said. \u201cIf the Minister\u2019s reasoning were accepted, we will soon have centres at universities for conducting research in Koodothram, Mashinottam, Chathanseva and other forms of black magic.\u201d\nThe society cautioned that education based on religious beliefs would torpedo the secular character of the country.\n"

Sitaraman, environmentalist, said that after a brief period when honest police officers had kept a tight leash over the menace by taking stern action against the offenders, the problem had re-emerged in many pockets in the rural areas of the district.\nHe said illegal sand-mining was progressing unchecked in Aluva and Perumbavur towns and Koovappady, Kalady, Kanjoor, and Okkal panchayats. The Parunthuranji Manappuram in Aluva has been reduced to just a shade over 30 acres from the original 52 acres thanks to illegal mining.\n\u201cPolitical and police nexus is facilitating illegal sand mining with upright police officers being moved out. Permits issued for legal mining is being exploited for illegal gratification, with local body members also sharing the spoils. The banned practice of pole and net scooping of sand is widespread in many parts of the district,\u201d Prof. Sitaraman said. He said not a single sand ghat could be allotted along the banks of Periyar as per the existing conditions.\n\nSand audit\n\nThe Kerala River Bank Protection and Regulation of Sand Mining Act, 2001, mandates sand audit every three years. However in the past 11 years since the Act came in to force, the Centre for Earth Science Studies (CESS) had conducted only two audits in the State \u2014 of the Periyar in Ernakulam and the Manimala flowing through Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts. Sand audit is now due in Ernakulam district. D. Padmalal, a scientist with CESS, said that sand audit was a complex process with mainly three stages.\n\u201cInitially, an exhaustive river mapping is done taking into account riparian vegetation, sand deposits, type of sand, structures on the banks of the river. Then mineable sand is calculated by applying the long list of conditions prescribed in the Act and the study conducted by our experts. The total mineable sand is then divided by the number of years left for 2030, the year in which the population in the State is expected to stabilize, to assess the sand that can be mined each year,\u201d he said.\nMr. Padmalal described sand as a divine mineral, which reduced the fury of water flow during monsoon, thus easing the pressure on structures along the river and preserving it. The loss of revenue by depriving the rivers of this precious commodity was incalculable.\nJohn Peruvanthanam, environmentalist, called for legislation exempting natural resources from human intervention to check practices such as illegal sand-mining and to achieve the larger goal of river protection.\n\u201cApart from the accepted classification of properties into private and public, the natural resources like rivers, wetlands, forests etc should be identified as a third type of property. The powerful and influential sand mafia will find a way to exploit loopholes and evade any other mechanisms like the deployment of police, river watchers or informers,\u201d he said.\nMr. Peruvanthanam said sand should be sourced from rivers in States like Bihar where it is in excess and made available as a packed product across the counter like other construction materials like cement and steel. Local bodies should not be given the powers to permit sand mining.\nThe former Revenue Minister K.P. Rajendran complained that State-wide surprise raids conducted four or five times a year during the previous Left Democratic Front government\u2019s term had been done away with by the present government. \u201cRaids were meticulously planned at the top level in utmost secrecy with the enforcing officials informed only in the last minute. They were very effective in checking illegal sand-mining,\u201d he said.\nDistrict Collector P.I. Sheikh Pareed said private sand parks had become a favoured point for illegally mined sand. Though he had banned such parks in panchayats with approved sand ghats, the operators secured a court stay against it. \u201cNow these parks can trade in illegally mined sand and claim that it was bought from outside that panchayat or even the State,\u201d he said.\nThe District Environment Committee has expressed its helplessness in dealing with illegal sand-mining, \u201cThis is a committee constituted by the Pollution Control Board and looks more at pollution management. If at all the committee is to tackle the issue then it must be made part of its defined role at the time of reconstitution, which is due. But as of now there is no such move,\u201d its chairman, G.

She has trouble falling asleep, shows suicidal tendencies, abuses her younger sister, and her mother is unsettled by the animal sounds the child makes from time to time. The mother takes the child to a psychiatrist, who after extensive examination, discovers that the child has been sexually abused.\nKuruppumpady police recently registered a case against the father of this six-year-old on charge of abusing her after giving her alcohol. The father is currently absconding.\nBut the child is suffering from severe mental trauma and may be becoming suicidal, said Ajeesh Ramachandran, psychiatrist at the Government Hospital at Aluva, who held extensive counseling sessions with the child.\nMore cases of children being abused in their own homes by close family are coming to light every day. What prompts a man to rape his own child, a niece or a nephew? \u201cChildren become targets because they can be deceived easily,\u201d said Dr. Ramachandran. Abusers entice them with chocolates or the promise of games or other fun activities and then abuse them. Children are also easily threatened into not revealing that they have been abused. Parents often discover that their children have been abused only when they show physical signs of abuse like skin abrasions or urinary tract infections. The influence of alcohol or drugs can also push people to sexually abuse children, says the doctor. He says that there is a high rate of drug use among people in the city between 18 to 30 years of age. While using drugs lowers their inhibitions, they may also come across other pedophiles in their circles, which could prompt them to abuse a child, he said.\nDr. Ramachandran said that pedophilia is rampant in the State. During an awareness class for a group of 100 students from a girls\u2019 school, more than 16 girls confessed to having been sexually abused. Abusers are typically close relatives or neighbours.\nIt is usually the mother or a teacher who brings the case to the attention of the police. Antony Jinoy, district co-ordinator of Childline, said a mother may find it difficult to believe that her husband would abuse their own child. Students sometimes confide in teachers or school counselors, who bring the case to the attention of Childline or the police.\nDue to the efforts of organisations like Childline to spread awareness among students, children themselves have approached Childline with their experiences of having been abused.\nJurist S. Gopakumaran Nair said that incest is nothing new in the State. Many children, boys and girls, are sexually abused in the State. Very few cases are reported to the police. Even fewer make it to the courts, he said. This is because of a taboo surrounding the subject.\n"

Their works or part of them hadn\u2019t arrived. \u201cYes, there were technical and logistic issues. While works of a few artists got stuck up with the Customs, a few got misdirected to other places,\u201d said a Biennale organiser.\nJoseph Semah\u2019s 72 copper plates that would be cardinal to his installation, for instance, somehow landed up in Mumbai. \u201cWe finally traced it.

True to spirit of incoherence and deviance that biennales are believed to foster, their art is as divergent as the best of contemporary art could be.\n\u201cTwenty-two out of 88 [artists] is good percentage. How could anyone then say that the biennale doesn\u2019t support local artists?\u201d asks Bose Krishnamachari, president of the Kochi Biennale Foundation and co-curator of the event.\nWalk into Aspinwall House and you have K. Raghunadhan, who has his studio at Eramalloor in Ernakulam, working on his fibreglass installation on the theme of a conservatory of sculptures. As is his wont, there\u2019s a dash of humour to his sculpture in the making, and it mocks at people for inflicting pain and angst on themselves. \u201cWe are bogged down by too many unnecessary preoccupations,\u201d he guffaws. The artist, who was part of the Indian Radical painters\u2019 Association in the mid-1980s, presents two works at the biennale: a 16-ft public sculpture in the old lighthouse area of Fort Kochi on \u2018a fisherman trying to dodge rising waves\u2019 and an assortment of sculptures forming part of an installation at Aspinwall House.\nAlex Mathew, who teaches at the School of Arts and Communication of the Central University of Hyderabad, is seeking to commandeer memories of Kerala\u2019s long-lost spice trade through his sculpture with an anchor as its central metaphor in the courtyard of the Pepper House. An iron chain goes curling up in the 10-ft high work.\nBack at Aspinwall House, Mr. Mathew\u2019s student Siji Krishnan, also based in Hyderabad, has her water colour work showing a cobweb with the artist\u2019s image entangled in it.\nThe image, depicting the artist as a winged being sporting creatures like an owl and several small insects, is in line with the kind of work she does. \u201cIt also features the image of a father figure, like my father who expired a few years ago,\u201d she says.\nValsan Koorma Kolleri, also at Aspinwall House, believes that nothing dies. \u201cEvery material has life, character and beauty,\u201d he proclaims. It is sad that we have to buy everything even to eat. So, a time has come for our species to master the art of recycling if we are to stay alive, he cautions and his work conveys the message loud and clear.\nT.R. Upendranath, a city-based artist, has his exhibition space at Aspinwall House filled with photographic prints featuring pages from old art magazines across the globe with an overlay of his varied images, 56 in all, on them.\nOne image, for instance, has the artist holding a coconut sapling while another features him in nude.\n"

They failed to realise that casteism was the core of the Indian social structure and that without eliminating caste, it was hard to win the class war.\nMr. James said it was because of the Communist Party\u2019s stand on castes that Ambedkar and his followers, who would have been the natural allies of the Communist movement, could not work together.\nThe CPI(M) was making a blunder by promoting the identity politics of the Dalit movement with the selfish interest of creating a Dalit vote bank for the party.

The once regaled drive-in beach at Muzhappilangad near here is turning into a death trap, diminishing its tourism prospects.\nThe drive-in beach, hailed as one of its kind in Asia, enables a drive through four kilometres on the seashore. The initial days after the opening of the beach more than a decade ago saw an influx of native population. It did not take long for anti-social elements to capture the beach. The result \u2013 arrival of foreign tourists at the beach reduced drastically, while natives dreaded spending a leisurely time there. Gradually, the beach lost its charm despite efforts by the Tourism Department to pep it up with projects such as a cafeteria, which stills awaits completion in terms of electrification, a walkway and a park, which were carried out under the Tsunami Rehabilitation Programme.\nThis, in a way, led to the thriving of criminal elements who often engaged in chain-snatching and similar crimes, while speeding vehicles on the shores resulted in accidents at regular intervals.\nAfter a series of accidents, including one in which a child was run over by a speeding vehicle, and a teenager who was killed on the spot, and three were seriously injured after their vehicle turned turtle on December 9, the police have closed the three entries to the beach.\nWith no proper security, the place has become a haven for anti-social groups. Moreover, the place is being utilised for taking driving lessons. It is a wise move to close down the beach for vehicles temporarily, said Edakkad Sub Inspector A.. Kuttikrishnan.\nThe District Tourism Promotion Council acknowledges it as an unsafe spot too.

Achuthanandan was the principal accused, the Opposition accused the government of having carried out an investigation with the clear intention of pinning down the Leader of the Opposition. Simultaneously, it was also engaged in an attempt to clear United Democratic Front (UDF) leaders and Ministers from Vigilance cases, they alleged.\nLeading the Opposition attack, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan (CPI-M) said no previous government had hounded the Opposition like the present one. The case against Mr. Achuthanandan and the manner in which the government had preferred an appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court against the Single Bench verdict smacked of undue haste.\nThe actions of the government in this and various other instances showed that it was using the VACB for its survival, Mr. Balakrishnan said. Responding to the allegations, Home Minister Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan said the government had moved the Division Bench in the \u2018land assignment case\u2019 only because the Single Bench\u2019s order was of \u2018unusual\u2019 nature and \u2018prima facie incorrect.\u2019\nThe Judge had refused to see the case diary despite the Director of Prosecution offering to submit it.\nThe UDF government did not believe in misusing the Vigilance investigation mechanism. It had decided on November 3 that there should be no more investigations on pseudonymous or anonymous complaints.\nIf anyone had misused the Vigilance, it was the last LDF government, which had ordered Vigilance investigation against nine prominent UDF leaders just before it went out of office, he pointed out.\nChipping in, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said there was no question of his government misusing the Vigilance machinery.\nHe had taken the decision to drop the investigation into the alleged sign board scam, only because he was convinced that there was no merit in the allegations and that the officials concerned had acted only in accordance with the directions given by the then Nayanar government.\n\u201cI do not take decisions worrying how it will affect me, but obeying my conscience,\u201d he said.\nLeading the walkout, Mr. Achutnanandan said he was being hounded by the government with a false case which had as its basis a land assignment which had not taken place. When the investigation seemed to be progressing in a motivated manner, he had written to the Director of Vigilance requesting him to change the investigating officer, but there was no response.\nThe government pushed ahead with the investigation by the same officer probably because of his statement that he would not continue as Leader of the Opposition if a charge sheet was filed against him. The High Court\u2019s observations were a reply to that.\nHe would continue to fight the case just as he did in the palmolein and ice-cream parlour case, Mr. Achuthanandan said.\n\n\nThiruvanchoor terms Single Bench order \u2018unusual\u2019\n\n\n\n\nLDF members walk out of Assembly\n\n\n"

The second stretch, the biggest hurdle, could be taken up only after the roads were widened. The DMRC had suggested that widening of the Karyavattom -Kesavadasapuram stretch should be handed over to a special agency like the Roads and Bridges Development Corporation. A special land acquisition officer should also be posted, it said.\nA car depot had been suggested at the Technocity end on 20 acres of government land. The stations had been mooted at Technocity, Pallippuram, Kaniyapuram, Kazhakuttom, Kazhakuttom Junction, Karyavattom, Gurumandiram, Pangappara, Sreekariyam, Pongumoodu, Ulloor, Kesavadasapuram, Pattom, Plamoodu, Palayam, Secretariat, Thampanoor, Killipalam, and Karamana.\nPresenting the DPR, DMRC Principal Adviser E. Sreedharan said there were provisions for flyovers at Kazhakuttom, Sreekaryam, Ulloor, Pattom, and Plamoodu Junctions. The stations at Kesavadasapuram and Thampanoor had been planned as junction stations for future monorail lines coming from MC Road side and Manorama Road side.\nThe projected traffic per day in 2015-16 would be 2.46 lakh; 2.67 lakh in 2021-22; 2.88 lakh in 2031-32; and 3.27 in 2041-42. The fares suggested varied from the minimum of Rs.8 for two km to Rs.30 for 18-24 km. However, the minimum fare projected for 2019 is Rs.11 and the maximum Rs.42.\nThe design of civil structures and specifications for systems and train sets were exactly the same mooted for the Kozhikode Monorail. The monorail would be fully elevated. The two-track beams would be on circular pillars about 30 metres apart, along the median of the road. Platforms would be on top of the road and all stations would have lifts and staircase.\nEach train would consist of three cars with a carrying capacity of 525 persons. Cars will have aluminium body and would run on rubber tyres. It would be fully air-conditioned and the vestibules would be wide.\nCommunication Based Train Control, the latest signalling system that allowed trains to run safely every 2 minutes, had been recommended to cater to the traffic demand up to 2041.\nInitially, trains would run every 5.5 minutes during peak hours. Driverless trains had been proposed. For safety, guards would be present.\nTwo receiving sub-stations, one at the depot at Technocity and the other at Kesavadasapuram had been proposed.\nAll the 19 stations would have a sub-station to meet power needs.\nA total of 17.170 hectares of land was needed for the project. Of this, 13.750 hectares was government land, 0.58 hectares was with Railways, and 2.820 hectares with private parties. Mr. Sredharan said only 39 families and 65 shops would be affected.\nThe completion cost on April 2019 will be Rs.3,590 crore with the cost per route km being Rs.161.71 crore. Since the internal rate of return (IRR) IRR is very low (0.67 per cent), the DMRC had said no private party will come forward to invest.\nThe monorail will have to be fully funded through Government initiative. It has suggested four funding operations, including a step loan from JICA.\nKerala Monorail Corporation Ltd (KMCL), the Special Purpose Vehicle, will implement the project.\nThe civil works and all systems including rolling stock should be packaged into one single contract and entrusted to the turnkey contractor.\n"

Nair and K.P. Rajesh, have named the new plant Symphysodontella madhusoodanii, after their guide Prof. Madhusoodanan, former Head of the Department of Botany, University of Calicut, and now Emeritus Scientist at the Malabar Botanical Garden, Kozhikode.\nThe paper authored by Dr. Manju and Dr. Rajesh has been published in the recent issue of Phytokeys, an open access journal dedicated to biodiversity research.\nThe new species was found growing on the branches of trees in the upper reaches of the Amarambalam Forests. \u201cIt is unique in many features,\u201d says Dr. Manju, a bryologist, also associated with the Malabar Botanical Garden, Kozhikode.\nEarlier, the bryophyte genus Symphysodontella was represented in India with three species, mostly from the north-eastern part of the country. One species, S. involuta, was known to occur in the Western Ghats also.\nS. madhusoodanii is characterised by long, drooping primary branches, short secondary branches and two costate (ridged) leaves. It is confined to the New Amarambalam Forests and the Mukuruti National Park across the border in Tamil Nadu, both of which harbour a fragile ecosystem, home to a unique assemblage of plants and animals. The New Amarambalam forests is also the home of the Cholanaikar tribe, a nomadic aboriginal group of few members.\nThe plant was collected by Dr. Rajesh during a Rapid Biodiversity Assessment survey in the New Amarambalam Reserve Forest area. The study was organised by the Malabar Natural History Society (MNHS) of Kozhikode for the Kerala Forest Department, under plans to designate the forest as a high value biodiversity area.\nThe survey supported by the Kerala Science, Technology Environment (KSCSTE), revealed the rich biodiversity of the area, and the need for better protection.\n\u201cThere was a plan to designate the forests of New Amarambalam as a wildlife sanctuary. That proposal has failed to materialise due to various reasons. We strongly feel that this area deserves better conservation status, taking into account the rich biodiversity waiting to be discovered,\u201d says Dr. Rajesh.\n"

Kerala is the first State in the country to have initiated the NABH accreditation programme for government-run blood banks,\u201d said Susheela Kamath, principal assessor of NABH for blood banks, who is leading the training programme.\nImproving the quality standards of blood banks does not mean just ensuring blood safety so that transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) are prevented.\n\u201cThe accreditation process is not just about preventing TTIs, it is about having standard procedures and systems in place to improve the quality and safety of collecting blood from a donor, its processing, testing, and transfusion. Blood transfused in an improper manner can cause the kidneys to shut down,\u201d said Dr. Kamath.\n\nManuals\n\n\u201cOne important aspect of accreditation is documentation and preparation of quality control manuals so that every blood bank staff knows what to do in every situation. There are 11 clauses of NABH standards for blood banks, including those about incident reporting and taking corrective action,\u201d said Atul Kulkarni, technical assessor, NABH.\nQuality improvement is a continuous process and if things are done at the right time in the right way mishaps can be avoided in blood banks.\n\u201cInvesting in the latest technology or sophisticated equipment alone will not improve quality. Mishaps can occur if the equipment is not calibrated or if the person handling it is not well-trained,\u201d Dr. Kulkarni said.\nDr. Kamath pointed out that generally \u2018haemo vigilance\u2019 was poor in the country and that it was time the government evolved a national policy on this.\n\u201cApart from stressing on prevention of TTIs, we do not yet have a proper system to track TTIs or transfusion reactions. There should be scope for self-reporting of any mishaps in blood banks and following up such incidents,\u201d she said.\nThe accreditation process is not an overnight affair and more training programmes will be conducted by QCI for the technicians of the blood banks.\n"

A \u2018tragedy\u2019 that he had been facing as the maker of Waati was that he had never been able to find the kind of music he was looking for. Now while in India, the idea had hit him of a possible collaboration for the purpose.\nThe same concept, he said, could be extended to other spheres of film-making, including scripts, screenplays and production as well. The joint ventures, however, should be done in the right spirit, by persons who would be committed to the task, with the intention to move forward come what may and willing to take risks at every level. The director should not have to make compromises, but be allowed to stick to his own vision of his movie.\nSuch ventures, which would help in a heady cultural mixture of India and Africa, would go a long way in nurturing cinema, he felt. Mr. Cisse was waiting for the screening of Waati during the IFFK here to see the response of the Indian audience to a movie that spoke about the apartheid in South Africa. He never considered Waati to be a failure though the people of his own country had not taken it seriously.\nThis was despite northern Mali now witnessing \u2018one form of apartheid\u2019 now.

The capital here generates 3,800 metric tonnes of garbage a day, of which it has been now established that about 3,200 metric tonnes is transported to the dump yard.\nAs of now, the garbage is being compacted only and not being used for any other purpose like generating power or pellets or even manure at Jawaharnagar. Ramky Enviro Engineers mandated with the task of constructing the Integrated Municipal Sold Waste Project in the Public, Private Partnership (PPP) mode has just about completed a few tasks at the site.\nA compost plant, a garbage-to-power generating plant and a sanitary landfill to store the inert waste are other pending jobs at the tertiary end for which the private firm has been permitted to take up. The municipal corporation\u2019s previous attempts to generate power from waste with the help of private firms have not been very encouraging. First such plant by Selco started promisingly before falling on the wayside caught in legal tangles with regard to the 10-acre land leased to it, royalty payments and also with tariff issues with the Transmission Corporation of A.P.

RDF\u2019s Rs.114 crore 11 MW plant coming up at Bibinagar is awaiting release of funds from the Centre and the GHMC to commission the plant whereas Sree Venkateswara is yet to get off the rails.\nRamky is expected to use 1,700 MTs with the other two to use 700 MTs each, therefore officials say there is enough garbage for the proposed compost plants as the daily turnover will only increase with growth \u2013 city and population.

Satti Babu, Allari Naresh movie retains the title of Chiranjeevi\u2019s 1988 blockbuster \u201cYamudiki Mogudu\u201d.\nGoing by the box office collections, all the movies right from Yamagola, Yamudiki Mogudu, Yamaleela, Yamadonga were all big hits. These films offer lot of entertainment and perhaps that\u2019s the reason even Vijayasanthi acted in E.V.V Satyanarayana\u2019s \u201cMagarayudu\u201d in 1995, says M. Swamy, founder of Drushyam.net website.\nAs these movies revolve around the roles of Yama and Chitragupta, many actors have grabbed the opportunities to play these roles. The pair of K. Satyanarayana and Allu Ramalingaiah still stands out and their performances in these characters are cherished by many.\nMohan Babu too performed as Yama in Junior N.T.R starrer \u201cYamadonga\u201d and in the latest movies, Srihari and Siyaji Sinde are playing the same roles.\nApart from the star cast, these films have all the ingredients such as comedy, action, romance, sentiment etc, which attract viewers. For producers, these stories always fetch good collections and that\u2019s the reason many films were made and would be made in the future as well, adds B. Ramakrishna, general secretary of Andhra Pradesh Cine-goers Association.\n\n\nWith the super success of movies with \u2018Yama\u2019 character, many new actors are trying their luck in the role\n\n\n"

B. Sanjeeva Reddy, principal of an IIT Academy here in Hyderabad says,\n\nSyllabus changed\n\n\u201cThe syllabus for this year has also been changed apart from the pattern, and we are training the students accordingly. We cannot estimate the standard of the papers; this is causing some anxiety to both teachers and students.\u201d\nThe Joint Entrance Examination will also be carrying a percentage of 12th board scores, a move by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) which came in for much criticism in the country.\nWhile many students say that it is not justified as the syllabus is not uniform in different States, CBSE seems to be aiming at a standardised entrance examination to avoid the hassle of giving different examinations. Ajith Reddy, student of a junior college in the city who is preparing for JEE (Mains) opines that the new pattern would mean that a student will have to fare consistently well in all the examinations, including the 12th boards, unlike previous years.\nHe adds, \u201cHaving focused equally well on the State\u2019s intermediate examinations, I feel confident about JEE (Mains). For those who wouldn\u2019t have done this, it might get difficult to appear for JEE.\u201d Andhra Pradesh has always held some of the topmost positions in the previously held AIEEEs and IIT- JEEs.\nWith many ambiguities in the changed pattern, one can merely hope that this test run of JEE would be of equally good possibility for the state students to conquer.\n"

While gynaecologists agree that fancy dates, like 11//11/11 of last year and the first day of the year are always in great demand, this year, however, there is not much demand to plan deliveries on 12/12/12.\nMany doctors, however, maintained that caesarean sections should only be done after women complete 36 weeks of pregnancy.\n\u201cFor unplanned deliveries, dates do not matter.

The timings of the Visakhapatnam \u2013 Chennai train is the same as the already running Bhubaneswar \u2013 Chennai weekly (which was extended from Visakhapatnam in the past).\n\nPatronage\n\nBut, the Puri \u2013 Chennai weekly express, which was already introduced, was completely given different timings. The train, which arrives here at 1.30 a.m., was not getting adequate patronage of Visakhapatnam passengers due to the odd hours. Those watching the developments allege that the days and timings of operation were intentionally chosen by ECoR, using its zonal powers, ignoring the interests of Visakhapatnam.\nThere was no proposal to run a train from Puri to Chennai prior to the 2011-12 budget. But, it was introduced though the demand was to introduce a bi-weekly train from Visakhapatnam to Chennai. The Visakhapatnam - Chennai train, presently runs as a weekly special, is actually not getting good response compared to other originating trains. ECoR could take advantage of the situation to extend this train on grounds of \u2018poor patronage\u2019. Though there is tremendous demand for a train to Chennai, the odd departure and arrival timings, is forcing passengers to look for alternative modes of transport.\nThe train should leave on Sundays around 4 p.m. to reach Chennai by 6 a.m. on Mondays.\nThis would be convenient for techies and others from the city living in Chennai or even for general passengers who could reach their destinations in Chennai before the rush hour begins.\nMinister for State for Commerce and Industries D. Purandeswari, who represents Visakhapatnam in Lok Sabha, and Minister of State for Railways Kotla Suryaprakash Reddy should intervene immediately in the matter and ensure that the timings and days of operations are modified before its introduction, feel those watching the developments.\n"

What makes every painting interesting is the message it delivers with every stroke of the brush. \u201cI feel every art should communicate one\u2019s thoughts and should be subject-oriented. The challenge lies in how you communicate through your work,\u201d artist Ramchand said about his works which have a message embedded in them. He says pain is the best teacher for anybody to explore the inherent talent. Though art is an inborn talent for many, it started off when Ramchand was studying in intermediate. \u201cI had to discontinue my studies due to financial problems. Out of the blue, I started painting and came out of my negative thoughts.\u201d From then on, painting became a passion that dominated his life. Ramchand pours life into canvas using mixed medium and other innovative techniques. And that\u2019s what makes his works special.\nHis creations like \u2018Uthsaham\u2019 designed with etching technique, \u2018explosion\u2019 with bright contrasting colours, \u2018gloomy and glory\u2019 expressing the dark and brighter side of human moods portray mixed feelings to detail. The monochrome technique of \u2018Contentment\u2019 depicts the beautiful relation between parents and child. The gallery also contains contemporary art with interesting collages. Emphasising on the benefits of painting, he said \u201cchildren of the present generation are becoming more mechanical and are focused on examinations. The real bliss lies in leading a stress-free life and that depends on taking up your passion as a career.\u201d Working as art teacher at Kendriya Vidyalaya of INS Kalinga, his permanent art gallery at Tarakarama Nagar soothes wounded souls.\n"

One of the officials came out and announced on the public address system that they would suspend issuing tokens if there was no order in the queue.\nY. Sampat Kumar, an employee of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, blamed the TTD officials for the unruly behaviour of the token-seekers.\n\nLathicharge\n\n\u201cThey should have deployed police on time to ward off an unpleasant situation,\u201d he said. N. Varalakshmi, who goes to Tirumala regularly, said what happened on Tuesday was unfortunate and the stampede could have been prevented. To prevent stampede, police resorted to mild lathicharge. The situation went out of control with one group of pilgrims insisting on issuance of tokens as they were in the queue from Monday evening and the TTD insisting that it would give the tokens on \u2018first come first serve\u2019 basis.\nAfter heavy jostling, some irate devotees at one point of time tried to gherao TTD officials and raised slogans against them for issuing tokens \u2018out of turn\u2019 to those known to them.\nThe last Vaikuntha Ekadasi was observed on January 5, 2012. It is a rare occurrence that two times Vaikuntha Ekadasi is being celebrated in one calendar year by allowing devotees to have Vaikuntha Dwara Darshan. The token quota was fixed for various areas by the TTD board.\n\n\nTTD officials have announced that they would issue only 1,800 tokens\n\n\n\n\nDevotees start forming queues from Monday evening itself\n\n\n"

This unique numerological combination has caught the fancy of many citizens who are taken in by the exclusivity of the date to symbolise a landmark occasion in their lives.\nExpectant parents, betrothed couples, sentimental investors, to those looking for a new house or even a new car; generally there are many who plan to make this day a momentous occasion in their lives. December, 12, 2012 or 12-12-12 will be the last date of its kind - when all three numbers in a date are the same - for the next 88 years. The next time this will happen is on January 1, 2101, (01-01-01).\nMost of the believers are convinced that the symmetry of 12-12-12 will bring good luck. According to numerology too the date 12-12-12 is considered lucky as it adds up to 9. Also, December 12, is the last repetitive date of the century, from 2013, such a combination of dates will not be available.\nWith many couples planning their wedding on this date, the city is abuzz with those wanting to make the most of the day. On a cynical note, with the Malayan calendar predicting 21 December to be doomsday, many want to live life to the fullest at least before the end! On a lighter note, with the shadow of the supposed doomsday looming only ten days later, indulging in a shopping spree on December 12, is perhaps the best way to initiate the countdown!\nAstrologically too the date is purported to be auspicious owing to the position of Jupiter. According to some astrologers, this date indicates harmony and strengthening of relationships. Even numerologists say that the lucky combination of number 12 is auspicious for starting new ventures or entering into partnerships.\nAccordingly, investments and shopping sprees are the next big thing planned for this day. Investing and bringing home the new car or coolest gadget is high on the list of priorities for many of the city\u2019s numerical geeks and sentimental folk. Gold and jewellery as an investment are highly favoured amongst householders. It is an investment that you can actually use or rather wear, and yet it has immense potential for increasing its worth. Astrology, numerology and sentiments apart, the 12 December \u201812 is cool date that would come only once in a century. In tune with the trend of making this date momentous, many stores in the city have stocked up with the latest and coolest gadget and gizmos in town.\nFurthermore, winter is the season for partying! In view of the ongoing festive and partying season, latest designer wear, accessories and gadgets have flooded the city stores. Pick and choose from designer dresses, western-wear, gorgeous saris and a host of accessories for the party season of the year.\nAs the New Year and Christmas parties draw closer, many of the movers and shakers in town are in the market for the trendiest accessories to flaunt; ranging right from watches to cars! If nothing else, there are quite a few who plan to make this day extra special for themselves, by indulging in a session at a spa or a visit to the saloon. Their idea of making this day special is to pamper themselves or even try out a new look for the upcoming spree of parties!\n- Uma Chodavarapu\n"

Of this, around Rs. 458.54 crore was for rehabilitation of WTP, booster pumping station, underground reservoir and laying of pipeline, installation of meters etc., and Rs.193.78 crore was estimated for road restoration. At some installations the rehabilitation work was added and enhanced to extend benefit to the private company. The cost is estimated at exorbitantly high and escalated prices. To reach to this cost, the consultant and DJB officers in connivance enhanced the scope of project and related data and figures were also fabricated to extend the benefit to the proposed company,\u201d alleged S.

What maintenance was done by private company running these pump houses?\u201d questioned Sanjay Sharma, also of the NGO.\nThe NGO has questioned the basis on which the estimates have been raised for the construction of new underground reservoir and booster pumping station at the cost of Rs. 53.31 crore.\n\u201cThe construction cost of a 68 Million Gallon (MG) pump house in Patna comes to Rs. 45.68 crore, which means Rs. 67.19 lakh per MG but in Delhi 14.5 MG pump house will be constructed at the price of Rs. 53.31 crore, which means Rs. 3.67 crore per MG. The DJB contracted the work of construction of pump house 5.47 times higher,\u201d Mr. Naqvi said.\nThe NGO has alleged that cost of several works including laying of pipelines and the automation cost is also escalated compared with other recent DJB projects.\n\u201cThe automation at Nangloi project is estimated at Rs.14 crore against the total cost of automation/ SCADA at 100 MGD Bhagirathi Water Treatment Plant with its vast distribution network including UGRs and BPSs estimated cost of Rs. 4.5 crore. The automation/ SCADA already exist at Nagloi UGR/ BPS and Mohan Garden UGR/ BPS in the Nagloi project,\u201d he said.\nDemanding an investigation into the award of the project and cost estimates, the NGO claims: \u201cThe actual cost of the Nangloi PPP project is not higher than Rs. 200 crore.\u201d\n"

            "body": "A paradigm change is happening to ensure the structural integrity of aerospace structures, in particular civil and military aircraft, according to Prof. C.R.L. Murthy, Professor of Aerospace Engineering, who has recently retired from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.\nProf. Murthy was delivering the Prof. A.K. Rao Memorial Lecture at the National Non-Destructive Evaluation Seminar (NDE-2012), which got under way at Sahibabad near Delhi on Monday. The talk was titled \u2018Non-Destructive Evaluation for Aerospace Structures: Past, Present and Future.\u2019 Prof. Murthy was Prof. Rao\u2019s student at the IISc.\nNDE or Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), as the term implies, refers to the techniques of analysis used in science and industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component or a system without causing damage to the object being analysed. The techniques include ultrasonic testing, acoustic emission, magnetic-particle and liquid penetrant testing, eddy-current testing and nuclear techniques, including radiography and neutron scattering methods.\nProf. A. K. Rao was an expert in the use of the acoustic emission technique to study the structural integrity of aircraft. Interestingly, his services were also used by the Department of Atomic Energy during the end-shield damage in RAPP-1 at Rawatbhata and pressure tube in MAPS at Kalpakkam years ago. From the early days of mere detection of defects, the NDE technology in the past included material characterisation and analysis and the present is moving towards Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), Prof. Murthy said. Much like a treadmill for cardiac function, SHM refers to monitoring the structure when it is working \u2014 and not only when it is on the ground \u2014 detect and interpret the \u201cadverse changes\u201d in the structure and provide intelligent estimates of the remaining useful life. Since failures are unavoidable, the philosophy in structural integrity through SHM methods has been to ensure \u2018safe life\u2019 rather than \u2018fail safe\u2019 structures.\nThe future will be towards making the probability of failure very small or high-damage tolerance.\nSHM includes the following five essential components: sensor technology, which is revolutionising NDE; diagnostic signal generation; signal processing; damage detection/identification and analysis; and, system integration. According to him, the concept of SHM is still evolving for aerospace structures, which are very complex and have complicated geometries.\n\u201cEven today,\u201d he said, \u201cno operational aircraft system, civil or military, is being monitored for health with sensors.\u201d While advances in the techniques of signal processing have enabled reduction of the uncertainty of failures, the idea of total system integration is on the horizon, Prof. Murthy said. Boeing will very soon be bringing to the market a commercial aircraft that incorporates SHM in the design, he said.\nAccording to him, the concept of a single black box for all the five functions is now becoming feasible with advances in VLSI technology. \u201cSensors can now be embedded in 3 mm size components,\u201d he said. SHM will make use of acoustic emission method in flight and ultrasonic method on the ground.\nThe former makes use of detecting and analysing in real-time the stress acoustic waves generated in the parts under strain and latter involves sending pulses of definite frequency to detect flaws in the system.\nLatest advances in SHM, to which work at the IISc too has contributed, include Monte Carlo techniques for uncertainty estimates, digital image correlation methods and graph theoretic methods for identifying least energy paths in an aircraft structure, rather than straight paths, along which acoustic waves travel.\nThe three-day conference has been organised by the Indian Society for Non-Destructive Testing founded in 1972, and is being attended by 500 delegates.\n\n\nFuture will be towards making the probability of failure very small or high-damage tolerance\n\n\n\n\nBoeing will very soon be bringing to the market a commercial aircraft that incorporates SHM\n\n\n"

As dusk falls over Pani Na Ghoda, rows of sadhus , Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leaders and local grandees from the influential Leuva Patel community pack the makeshift stage. The street fills up, and a never-ending line shuffles up to Mr. Patel to felicitate him with a shower of flowers, garlands, even a sword. The crowd cheers.\nAs people look down from their balconies, all the speakers focus on the water crisis \u2014 the severe shortage of drinking and irrigation water, they say, has ruined their crops and forced farmers to commit suicide. Senior RSS leader Praveen Maniar compares Mr. Modi to Hitler, and pitches into Bharatiya Janata Party MP Navjot Singh Sidhu for calling Keshubapa \u2014 as he is known here \u2014 a traitor. (Both Mr. Maniar and Praful Sejaliya, who heads the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, an RSS outfit, are with Mr. Patel.\nThis is the heart of Saurashtra which, along with Kutch, holds the key to the Gujarat elections. For, it will send 54 MLAs to the 182-member Assembly from the eight districts of Surendrangar, Rajkot, Amreli, Bhavnangar, Junagadh, Porbandar, Jamnagar and Kutch. In 2007, before delimitation, it sent 58. It is home to the numerically strong Leuva Patels, traditional BJP supporters, with strong interests in agriculture, industry and the diamond business. Indeed, it is the Patels of Saurashtra who are the backbone of the diamond industry in Surat in south Gujarat. In 2007, the BJP won 43 seats in the Saurashtra-Kutch belt, the Congress 14 and the Nationalist Congress Party one. This time, the Congress is pinning its hopes on the GPP wresting a few seats from the BJP, and shaving off votes from the latter\u2019s candidates so that it can double its tally from the region. Little wonder, the Congress is concentrating on this region. Party president Sonia Gandhi has already addressed rallies here in Rajkot and in Junagadh, and general secretary Rahul Gandhi will travel to Jamnagar and Amreli on Tuesday.\nMr. Keshubhai Patel\u2019s exit from the BJP \u2014 which he helped build in Gujarat \u2014 has been a blow to the ruling party, and his GPP is seen as the main reason why Mr. Modi was unable to deny ticket to many sitting MLAs, who have grown unpopular over the last five years. In 2007, Mr. Patel was merely a dissident; this time, he is being taken more seriously now that he has formed his own party. Mr. Modi, who attacks the Congress daily, has refrained from attacking Mr. Patel, aware of his hold over his community as well as strong ties with the RSS.\nHere at Pani na Ghoda, on December 6, when the 84-year-old Keshubapa starts speaking, the audience hangs on to his every word as he reminds the people of how much he has done for farmers in the region. Careful not to alienate non-Patels, he stresses that the neglect of Saurashtra by the Modi regime affects all castes, and not just the Patels. He points out that in an age when even cloth does not sell at Rs. 2 a metre, farm lands in this area have been given to the Adanis at Rs. 2 a square metre. And then he does one better than Mr. Maniar and compares Mr. Modi to Goebbels. As Mr. Patel drops his voice to explain Goebbels\u2019 technique of repeatedly telling lies till until they appeared to be the truth, the crowd roars with laughter and cheers him on. A man standing next to me says: \u201cModi will lose 125 per cent.\u201d\nWhether Mr. Modi will lose or not is another matter. But it is clear, as I travel through a swathe of Saurashtra, that with the crippling water crisis and spiralling prices fuelling the anger against the incumbent government, the GPP and to some extent the Congress are creating an undercurrent of resentment. If the Leuva Patels are vociferous in opposing Mr. Modi, some of the other communities also express their feelings in a more moderate language.\nIn Surendranagar district\u2019s Vithalgad village, for instance, dominated by the Kolis, Bhadwads and Dalits, one man steps forward to say Mr. Modi has done a great deal of vikas (development). The others burst into laughter and tell me that the first speaker, a milkman, has indeed progressed because the price of milk has doubled but they haven\u2019t. When another man says there has been no corruption in the Modi regime, the others castigate him as a dalal (a middleman). Then the conversation turns to Adani and how he got land at a throwaway price.\nNear Gondal town, in Rajkot district, when I introduce myself to a group of Leuva Patels, who have gathered at a brand new cooperative housing society in which they have all bought flats, they all try to outshout one another to say that the only person who has done anything for the farming community is Keshubapa and that Mr Modi\u2019s focus has been big industry, not the aam admi . \u201cListen, don\u2019t just write this \u2014 go and meet Mr. Modi and give him a personal message from us,\u201d is Rameshbhai Patel\u2019s parting shot to me.\nIn Keshod in Junagadh district, a group of Ahirs says the only progress the people have seen in the neighbourhood is the highway that links Verawal to Jetpur, but where they live in \u2014 and they gesture to the potholed road \u2014 there has been no development.\nAnd in Pania in Amreli district, villagers tell me that they are determined to see that the sitting BJP MLA, Dilip Sanghani, is defeated: he is \u201ccorrupt\u201d and there is no water and electricity.\nIf the GPP and the Congress are tapping this anger, there is also Naresh Patel, a wealthy businessman and prominent Leuva Patel leader, who has been working for a year to \u201cunite\u201d them through the construction of a temple dedicated to the goddess they worship. Publicly, he is quick to say he is not telling people which way to vote.\n\u201cMembers of the community should decide on the basis of candidate, priorities of the entire community and the threats they face as a community,\u201d he says. What are those problems? \u201cI mean largely the problem of land-grabbing, the financial burden on farmers, rampant loot, suicides. The Leuva Patels need to unite so that they can deal with threats collectively. I am trying to bring unity in the community.\u201d The message seems to be clear.\n"

Though the waste produced from reactors is minimal, it will be highly radioactive. However, safety measures incorporated in reactors will not allow the radiation to be transmitted from the reactor core, the official said.\nSince the KKNPP had been constructed with 7-tier safety arrangements, there was no chance of radiation getting transmitted from the reactors to the atmosphere.\nTo ensure there was no significant rise in terrestrial radiation in villages around the site once the reactors became operational, the NPCIL conducted a pre-operational survey in every village under Radhapuram taluk in the district in the last quarter of 2006 to prepare a baseline data on natural background radiation.\n\u201cOnce the monitoring stations, fabricated by Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, are established in the villages, the present readings on background radiation recorded by these centres at any given time can be compared with the baseline data. If any abnormality is noticed, it means something is abnormal. Besides ensuring transparency in our functioning, this attempt will also instill confidence in the minds of the public,\u201d said the official.\n"

According to police sources, the memories of the first gang war in Gurgaon date back to 1996 when the gangs of Bunty alias Fauji, a resident of Teekli village, and Rajje battled it out in Jharsa and the latter was killed in the fierce exchange of fire.\nYet another dreaded gang called \u201cD Company\u201d was led by Badshapur-resident Dilip, a dismissed Delhi Police constable. The gang notorious for threatening and extorting money from industrialists, jewellers and doctors was also involved in the murder of owner of S. S. Jewellers in Old Gurgaon in the late 1990s. Dilip was arrested in 2001 following which the gang fell apart. With the passage of time, some of the gangs were neutralised by the police and others fell apart with their leaders being arrested and put behind the bars leading to peace in the area, said the police sources. In 2006 Chailu, a notorious gangster, was shot dead in a gun battle with a rival group at Rajiv Chowk.\nA major hub of economic activity, Gurgaon is also notorious for its trigger-happy culture with the most shocking case being that of a 14-year-old student of a well-known school who was shot dead by two of his classmates inside the school premises in 2007. The victim and the two assailants belonged to families of realtors and had a scuffle two days earlier over a minor issue. In a similar case, a toll attendant was shot dead by a commuter at the Kherki Daula toll plaza on Delhi-Gurgaon expressway in September last following an argument over payment of toll.\nThe criminals operating in southern Haryana, mostly from the Mewat region, also sneak into the Capital to commit crimes and the issues regarding their activities are frequently taken up by the Delhi Police with their Haryana counterparts, especially at the inter-State coordination meetings.\nThe city has been one of the chosen routes of numerous gangs from Mewat who perpetrate violent crimes like murder, dacoity and carjacking in the Capital.\n\u201cThe influx of hardened criminals from Mewat, who are usually armed with country-made weapons, has been a steady trend since long. A sizable part of crimes reported in the Capital can be attributed to these gangs which employs ruthless ways. They operate in large groups, mostly use mini-trucks as getaways and resort to firing or even pelting the police with stones to evade arrest. On several occasions, they are even knocked down and attempted to kill policemen on their trail,\u201d said a police officer.\n\u201cIn fact, we have arrested a large number of such criminals,\u201d said a police officer.\nInvestigations have revealed that even sophisticated illicit weapons being manufactured at Munger in Bihar besides Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr and Meerut in Uttar Pradesh are getting into the hands of criminals operating in Gurgaon.\nAnother area of concern is personal enmities, property dispute being a major factor, which on several occasions spills over across the border at times leading to violent clashes in the outskirts of Delhi.\n"

But the problem of air pollution continued to nag him. He divided his students into teams to study carbon and came up with interesting and disturbing facts that were uploaded onto a website that generated a lot of interest from many people towards the issue of carbon pollution.\n\u201cWhile in 1947, the population of Bhopal was 73,000, in 2011 it reached 2.3 million. While in 1947 there were 1,000 vehicles on the road, today there are more than 75 lakh registered with the RTO. The hike in construction activity has resulted in deforestation of a high degree. In that year there were less than 10,000 households while today there are 3.42 lakh households. All this has resulted in high release of carbon in the air,\u201d says Tiwari, standing at his stall displaying his project at Microsoft Partners in Learning Global Forum in Prague, where he has been invited along with other government teachers and members of the media from across the globe in recognition of his successful use of IT enabled education in the classroom.\nTiwari goes on to say that there is 16.8 per cent toxic carbon in the air of Bhopal today which is set to go up to 40 per cent in the next 25 years, if nothing is done. He launched an IT enabled program to raise awareness about the same.\nFiroz Khan of Primary School Chidawk, Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh is another teacher invited by Microsoft for his innovative teaching method in the classroom. He designed a website called Chemistry Mystery with ICT and other soft skills and used it as a tool to make the subject of Chemistry appealing to students of classes 10 and 12.\nFiroz used easy tools of graphs and flashpoint to make complex concepts of chemistry such as functioning of a nuclear reactor for the production of energy, simple and interesting to learn.\nUnfettered by the lack of infrastructure in the school, Firoz used his own and other friends\u2019 laptops in the classroom.\nHe says, \u201cThere are many problems in our school, we do not even have computers. But once I realised the potential of IT in teaching methods, there was no looking back and with the help of friends was able to use these tools in the classroom.\u201d\nThe classification of mixtures, differences between pure substances and mixtures with examples, difference between elements and compounds and information contained in the chemical formula of a compound, are now all available to Firoz\u2019s students at the click of a mouse.\nMamta Narula of Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj in New Delhi was another teacher to be recognised for her IT innovations in the classroom.\n\u201cToday\u2019s students are tomorrow\u2019s future.

But there have been so many politically motivated attempts to bar me from contesting because the opposition is fair clear that they will not be able to win against me. We have a lot of support in the country. The violent repression against people has made people look towards us. And I think that the three-and-a-half years of our government we have been able to bring about a lot of transformation of the country and we feel that people like it,\u201d he said. Getting the financial system back on track, reducing reliance on indirect taxes and levy of direct taxes, and putting in place an enormous social protection programme were among his main achievements as President.\nAsked what course of action the MDP would adopt in case he is debarred from contesting, he warned the government against adopting such tactics. \u201cI am afraid the MDP\u2019s reaction to such an eventuality will be very radical. I would not like to speculate on it but there are openly now talking of a revolution,\u201d he said.\nOn the MDP strategy in the court, he said the MDP did not have one. \u201cNothing, nothing\u2026 It\u2019s all motivated. It is not really a court. The manner in which the courts have been acting, even to the Parliament is also ridiculous,\u201d he said. Mr. Nasheed was referring to the court admitting a petition challenging Parliament approving using secret ballots to impeach President and members of the Cabinet. This was a rare MDP victory in recent times in Parliament. They had managed to win the support of two other parties, and the move was approved, catching the Waheed government on the wrong foot.\nCommenting on the lessons he learnt in his journey since 2008, Mr. Nasheed said: \u201cIt is easy to topple a dictator, but it is not easy to oppose a dictatorship.\u201d\nOne major criticism that Mr. Nasheed faced when he was in power was that he refused to work together with alliance partners. Asked if this was a fair criticism, he said: \u201cI am prepared to work with them\u2026 We do believe that the country is in transition. Therefore we must be able to work with other ideologies and other philosophies.\u201d But the MDP strategy, since it has a grass roots political party structure, is to garner a single party majority. This was because Mr. Nasheed believes that the \u201cunity\u201d model of government does not work. Commenting on the manner in which the investigation into the first political murder was progressing, he said the government was trying to \u201cframe\u201d the MDP in every single case. The police had picked a senior MDP functionary\u2019s relative after ruling party MP Afrasheem Ali was murdered in October. \u201cThey are just framing everyone,\u201d he claimed.\nMr. Nasheed, who was the architect of the deal that resulted in GMR taking over operations of the Ibrahim Nasir International Airport at Male in 2010, said once he comes back, GMR would be invited to resume operations. \u201cWe will come back to government and we will invite GMR back to the Maldives. And hopefully the partnership can still continue. I am very encouraged that the company understood it was not national interest or economics that was involved in [terminating the contract]. We would like Indian government to give assurances to their multinational companies to say that their contract will also be defended by their government,\u201d he said.\nAsked if he was upset that India was the first country to legitimise the transfer of power to his successor Mohamed Waheed, he said relationship with India was not dependent on his political fortunes.\nAsked if he believed there was a China angle to the airport take over, Mr. Nasheed did not confirm nor deny the possibility. \u201cIt is very difficult to believe that Waheed can do this by himself without a lot of strength from elsewhere. So it might very well be that it is coming from those quarters. We don\u2019t want power games in the Indian Ocean arena. We want a stable Indian Ocean,\u201d he said.\n"

The awards can go to much younger researchers than typically receive the Nobel prize, as experimental proof of theoretical work is not required.\nIn an e-mail to The Guardian , Prof. Hawking said he was \u201cdelighted and honoured\u201d. \u201cNo one undertakes research in physics with the intention of winning a prize. It is the joy of discovering something no one knew before. Nevertheless prizes like these play an important role in giving public recognition for achievement in physics. They increase the stature of physics and interest in it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAlthough almost every theoretical physicist agrees with my prediction that a black hole should glow like a hot body, it would be very difficult to verify experimentally because the temperature of a macroscopic black hole is so low,\u201d he added.\nThe physicist, who rose to fame with his 1988 book, A Brief History of Time , has not settled on how to spend the windfall. \u201cI will help my daughter with her autistic son, and maybe buy a holiday home, not that I take many holidays because I enjoy my work,\u201d he wrote.\nMr. Milner (51) holds an advanced degree in theoretical physics from Moscow State University, but abandoned a PhD at the Russian Academy of Sciences for an MBA at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. He remains a physics enthusiast though, and established the awards to recognise the greatest minds in fundamental physics, and help them to make significant contributions in the future.\nMr. Hawking (70) is not the only winner. The scientists who led the Large Hadron Collider and discovered what looks like the Higgs boson share another $3 million prize. The winnings go to Lyn Evans, the head of the LHC, and the six past and present heads of the two detector groups, Atlas and CMS, which found the particle.\nAlong with the special prizes for Mr. Hawking and the CERN researchers, the committee named a handful of other physicists who are shortlisted for the $3 million Fundamental Physics Prize, to be announced at Cern in March next year.\nThe conditions attached to the prizes require the winners to give at least one annual public lecture on their field. Most of the talks will be recorded and posted on the website of the foundation that supports the awards. \u2014 \u00a9 Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2012\n\n\nBritish theoretical physicist says he will spend world\u2019s most lucrative science prize, set up by Russian billionaire, on a holiday home and his autistic grandson\n\n\n"

This habit has come to rest on a simple formula: no restraint, no boundaries, no nuance, no subtlety, no time for class or technique, no thought for long-term consequences, just a victory, here and now.\n\nInfectious mood\n\nHow infectious this mood has already become was evident in last week\u2019s debate in Parliament on the FDI issue. In the manner of a limited overs contest, the debate degenerated into a raw confrontation between the ruling party and its detractors.\nSushma Swaraj, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, otherwise a mild-mannered leader with a becoming sobriety, gave in to this mood \u2014 with totally unintended consequences. Not satisfied with being personal and offensive to the Congress president, she shrilly suggested that the Uttar Pradesh-based parties \u2014 the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party \u2014 were obliged to help the government out because the Central Bureau of Investigation had been unleashed on the leaders of these two outfits.\nAs she saw it, the issue was not the presumed merits or deficiencies in the government\u2019s initiative; rather it was a simple matter of \u201cFDI vs. CBI\u201d \u2014 a classic T20 formulation.\nBut as with the new kind of cricket so in the political arena, aggression and recklessness cannot remain the monopoly of one side; the rules give all other protagonists the same freedom to respond in a manner of their choice.\nIt was left to Ms Mayawati \u2014 habitually denounced by the self-appointed arbiters of good taste and intellectual rationality \u2014 to take on the Leader of the Opposition, and reframe the issue. In particular, Ms Mayawati served notice that the BJP\u2019s cultivated T20 bad manners would not go unanswered and would, in fact, invite retaliation in kind. She did more than that. The BSP leader framed her argument in an institutional context: a government defeat would embolden the BJP to continue its two-year-old strategy of parliamentary disruption, a technique that had already eroded parliamentary institutions\u2019 credibility and respect.\nLike everyone else, Ms Mayawati knew that a setback on the FDI issue would have been much more than a defeat for the Manmohan Singh government. It would have advertised to every stakeholder at home and abroad that the Indian parliamentary system was no longer able to generate for the executive the requisite legislative sanction behind any kind of policy coherence. She unwittingly ended up providing a much-needed refurbishing to the basic scheme of our constitutional arrangements.\nLast week\u2019s debate underscored a larger purpose: the inherent fairness of our constitutional design. The BSP leader indicated that her party and its social constituency of the lower castes and classes see merit in making good use of the parliamentary processes to demand and secure their share of the national pie. Unlike the Anna crowd and its political partner, the National Democratic Alliance, the BSP, at least, has every reason to want to abide by the Constitution because it knows that it is only the Constitution of India and its promise of an egalitarian order that would enable the marginal groups to secure a fair deal for themselves.\nIt is indeed somewhat mystifying as to why Ms Swaraj, who otherwise has the temperament of a one-down batsman in a five-day cricket test match, got seduced into recklessness. Perhaps the only explanation is that the BJP (as also its cheerleaders in the media) has been taken in by the success notched up by the Gujarat Chief Minister in the style of a limited overs-swashbuckler.\nIn fact, Narendra Modi is the first political leader of some consequence who has built up an aura around himself by rough-talking. His handlers have crafted a macho image for him, which now critically hinges on his perceived ready and uninhibited willingness to bad-mouth anyone; he has been projected as having the ability to \u201ctake on\u201d anyone, and that he is unafraid of any holy cow. Mr. Modi is loud and immodest in self-praise and self-promotion; unrestrained in his nasty comments about Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. He tickles our baser instincts, makes us feel good in our small-mindedness. So invidious a toll has the Modi-type aggression taken on our collective sensibilities that a gentle, soft-spoken Manmohan Singh is dismissed in middle class conversations as a namby-pamby.\n\nNew media\n\nThat aggression has been exponentially facilitated by the new media. The electronic news channels have done their own bit in promoting this itch to be boorish. The shouting and bad manners that passes for \u201cdiscussion\u201d and \u201cdebate\u201d on television has bred a culture of low tolerance and baser prejudices. The middle classes who otherwise take pride in their refinement in taste and cultural immersions find themselves addicted to the display of bad manners, hectoring and scolding night after night. It was this T20 culture that provided the perfect background for the India Against Corruption \u201cmovement.\u201d\n\nCarnivals of accusation\n\nAnna and his gang mesmerised us with their own version of loudmouthed righteous denunciation. They staged vastly entertaining carnivals of accusation, where a handful of honest deshbhakts gave the appearance of taking on a whole legion of the corrupt and venal. For a while it seemed that name calling had become our national pastime. But they lost the plot when Arvind Kejriwal and Prashant Bhushan went overboard and accused even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of being corrupt. Anna\u2019s so-called team melted away when the corporate sponsors tightened the purse-strings, and its warriors got entangled in their internal acrimonious contradictions. But the nation \u2014 particularly the middle classes \u2014 have got addicted to the daily dose of name calling. It is this addiction that periodically goads Kejriwal & Co. to make a nuisance of itself outside this or that VIP\u2019s residence, hoping that the Delhi Police will get provoked into acting ham-handedly.\nViolence in our daily political discourse is bound to breed violent proclivities in political society. The very fact that anchors can no longer talk softly in front of television cameras prompts everyone else to raise their voices and shout down others with unreasonableness, anger and acrimony. Political rivals are increasingly finding it difficult to communicate across lines of hardening polarisation. Political parties first find themselves having to field a few Rottweilers on the nightly name-calling contests, and then get trapped in the studio-generated bad vibes and bad blood. A take-no-prisoners attitude has come to dominate even routine political exchanges.\nThis approach to public life has distracted political parties from their basic mandate: to initiate their cadres into ideas and ideology, and then empower them to take the case to the citizens at large. Today, leaders in the public sphere get defined not by their ideas but by their antics. Their T20 orientation does not equip political leaders for the time-consuming, painstaking, unglamorous chores of governance. The polity is losing its capacity to serve both society and the state.\n\n(Harish Khare is a senior journalist and public commentator.)\n\n\nJust as a few victories in limited overs cricket do not equip a team for Tests,\n\n\n\n\nloud-mouthed aggression in politics does\n\n\n\n\nnot generate governing capacity or trust among citizens\n\n\n"

He studied law and runs Naujawani.com , a popular internet radio station and internet TV that broadcasts content for a global Sikh audience. He is a blogger too \u2014 on the topic of what he calls injustices against the Sikh community in India. His latest post asks Sikhs to sign an online petition to free Kulbir Singh Barapind and Daljit Singh Bittu, arrested by the Punjab police in September for allegedly reviving the outlawed Khalistan Zindabad Force.\nHe and his friends also support \u201cIPledgeOrange\u201d or \u201cKesri Lehar\u201d (Orange, the colour of sacrifice, is also that of Sikhism\u2019s pennant), another online campaign launched by the United States-based Sikhs for Justice that petitioned the British Parliament on Monday for a debate on the \u201catrocities on minorities in India.\u201d The campaign seeks to free Balwant Singh Rajoana, on death row for engineering the bomb blast that killed the Punjab Chief Minister, Beant Singh, and 17 others in 1995.\n\u201cIPledgeOrange\u201d also runs Rajoana TV, which features half-hour episodes in English focusing on events connected with the March turmoil in Punjab, when Rajoana\u2019s scheduled execution was stalled following a Statewide protest. A young shorn Sikh boy with a British accent eulogises Rajoana and Jagtar Singh Hawara (also convicted for the same offence) and plays on notions of injustice, and denial of equality and freedom to the Sikhs.\nForget the images of saffron robed jathedars wearing long beards and kirpans uttering full throated cries of \u201c Jo Bole So Nihal \u201d that characterised the Khalistan campaign of the 1980s. These are educated, suave youngsters, most likely to be born and raised in the West. They talk of love, peace and humanity in the same breath that they talk of atrocities against Sikhs. Their heros are icons of the Khalistan movement such as Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, Rajoana or Hawara.\nSince February this year, when Sikhs across the world rose against the impending hanging of Rajoana, young Sikhs in the diaspora in particular have started what the police call a cyber war for Khalistan. The propaganda overdrive, through scores of web sites and social media platforms, is aimed at the young and impressionable, feeding them a diet of one-sided stories on the theme of injustice and the government\u2019s failure to protect Sikh rights and interests.\n\nNew DGP\n\nThe appointment of Sumedh Singh Saini, a much feared police officer for his role in eliminating terrorism in Punjab, as the State director general of police in February coincided with the February stir against Rajoana, and provided much grist to the mill.\nSample this excerpt from a video devoted exclusively to Saini, on Rajoana TV. \u201cMr. Saini was drafted at that time for a reason; because he is a trained killer, with the blood of thousands of Sikhs on his hands.\u201d Graphic pictures of a Sikh family allegedly slaughtered by Saini, appear in the video. The soft voice on the audio, intones: \u201cThis man is in charge of policing my State and my people. Can we expect any justice?\u201d\nPolice officers admit that law enforcing agencies have so far been unequal in this unfolding arena. \u201cIt is vigorous and potent,\u201d says a police officer.\nBut those behind the cyber propaganda are at pains to stress they are not extremists. \u201cWe do not want fighting or bloodshed. Khalistan means different things to different people,\u201d Mr. Mandher told The Hindu in an emailed response, \u201cwhether they are in the West or in Punjab.\u201d\n\nCanadian PM\u2019s statement\n\nThe Sikh diaspora\u2019s efforts to fuel revival of interest in Sikh issues abroad paid off when Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said during a visit to India last month that advocating for Khalistan by the Sikh community is not a crime. Harper\u2019s statement is plastered on most websites devoted to Sikh issues.\nIn March, when Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal visited the U.S. to attend a wedding, Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) ambushed him with a federal civil lawsuit alleging that he oversaw the torture of Sikhs in India. A court in Wisconsin issued summons against Badal on the SFJ\u2019s complaint.\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun, who heads SFJ, is seeking to internationalise India\u2019s failure to punish the perpetrators of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, while handing out death sentences to the Sikhs who reacted in anger at those incidents.\nSaid Pannun, \u201cThis suit will send a strong message to political leaders that they are answerable to the international laws and the courts for their role in gross human rights violations.\u201d\nThe Punjab government dismissed the radical\u2019s move as a \u201ccheap and desperate publicity stunt\u201d by \u201cmarginalised elements\u201d who had a violent communal agenda.\n\n\u2018Unsettled resentment\u2019\n\nBut voices within the Sikh community warn against dismissing the welling anger as the fulminations of a fringe group. \u201cThis unsettled resentment [over the 1984 riots] is manifesting itself in demands like opposition to the hanging of former terrorists or to have a memorial for Operation Bluestar.\nIt reinforces the sentiment that laws are only meant to be used against the Sikhs and not for their benefit,\u201d said H.S. Phoolka, a Supreme Court advocate who has been fighting for justice to the 1984 victims.\nYoung Sikhs are increasingly drawing comparisons between the treatment meted out to them and the Shiv Sena.\n\u201cThere have been at least three recorded shootings by the police of unarmed Sikh teenagers who have been peacefully protesting against the government. While in contrast, the \u201cShiv Sena Group,\u201d which is an anti-minority, fascist, pro Hindu group, has been allowed, and in many situations, provided security protection by the paramilitary and police forces, while making anti-minority speeches and threats against the minority community,\u201d says the Kesri Lehar petition.\nAll this is not to suggest that an uprising is even remotely on the cards. It is widely acknowledged that the people\u2019s rejection of terrorism was the main reason that Punjab returned from the brink. The new calls to resolve Sikh issues use only democratic methods. Young educated Sikhs living abroad, are beginning to question, in democratic ways, if what happened in Punjab in the 1980s was justified after all. Their questions now are not so much about the old territorial or river waters issues but whether Sikhs have been discriminated against by India\u2019s politico-legal system in the last two decades. What is worrying is that the voices are becoming insistent and even moderate Sikhs find it hard to fault their logic.\n\n\nEfforts by sections of the Sikh community, especially in the diaspora, to revive interest in what they describe as unsettled injustices of the 1980s \u2014 but what the police say is\n\n\n\n\na renewed campaign for Khalistan \u2014 are fast drawing in the youth\n\n\n"

            "body": "Seven months after the term of Nepal\u2019s Constituent Assembly (CA) ended without delivering a constitution, Nepali politicians agree that fresh elections to a new CA must be held in April-May 2013. But unlike functional democratic set-ups, the issue of how to get to elections has polarised Nepali polity.\nHere is the problem. The interim constitution does not envisage a second CA poll. To amend the constitution, President Ram Baran Yadav needs to use his constitutional \u201cpower to remove obstacles,\u201d on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers.\nPresident Yadav has refused to exercise this power and asked for a political consensus first. This is elusive since the Opposition parties, led by the Nepali Congress (NC) and Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist), have demanded that they be given the leadership of the government. The ruling Federal Democratic Republican Alliance (FDRA), of the Maoists and Madhesi parties, has instead urged the Opposition to join the Baburam Bhattarai-led government. Elections announced for November 22 could not be held. And the possibility of April polls is getting increasingly slim.\n\nPresidential move\n\nClaiming his intention was to resolve the deadlock, President Yadav called for a consensus Prime Minister on November 23. The move triggered off events and has dragged the office of the President into a controversy.\nOpposition parties put forward the NC president, Sushil Koirala, as their prime ministerial candidate. The NC\u2019s claim for leadership rests on two grounds \u2014 that both the Maoists and the UML have led two governments each since 2008 and now it is the NC\u2019s \u201cturn\u201d; and an agreement in May had provided for the NC leading the election government.\nThese are shaky grounds. All governments since 2008 have been elected by a majority on the floor of the house. Asking for leadership in the spirit of consensus is based on selective amnesia when the NC has been at the forefront of opposing any Maoist-led government. The May agreement promised the NC leadership, but only after constitutional issues were agreed upon. The Maoists and Madhesi parties in government blame the NC\u2019s opposition to identity-based federalism for the failure to draft a constitution, and claim the pact is not relevant anymore.\n\nMaoist proposals\n\nWhile critics have blamed Maoists for the impasse, party chairman Prachanda has been active in putting out one proposal after another to break the deadlock.\nSoon after the CA ended, he suggested that parties should try to find a middle way on issues of the constitution, revive the CA, and promulgate the constitution. The Maoists agreed to postpone the specifics of federalism, as long as the different models on the table were attached as an annex to the constitution. But both the NC and President Yadav were opposed to the CA\u2019s revival, which buried the idea.\nThe Maoists then urged the Opposition to join the Bhattarai cabinet, since there was no legitimate way to replace the Prime Minister in the absence of parliament. To allay apprehensions that Maoists would misuse state apparatus during elections, Mr. Prachanda offered the home ministry to the NC, and the finance ministry to the UML. He also asked the NC to appoint its nominee as the chief election commissioner. The Opposition however rejected this possibility too.\nThe Maoist-Madhesi alliance suspects that the NC only seeks government leadership, and will not hold timely CA polls. That is why they have said they would accept Sushil Koirala as the prime minister, only as a part of a \u201cpackage deal.\u201d\nThis deal, according to the FDRA, should include the date of elections, the election system and number of seats, the way to clear constitutional and legal hurdles, and how to fill vacancies in constitutional offices including the Election Commission, which will be left with no commissioners by January, and the Supreme Court, which is operating with less than half of its bench strength. Additionally, there must be a mechanism to preserve the work that has been done by the last CA, even if contentious issues like federalism are to be decided later. The NC has rejected the idea of a package deal too.\nMr. Prachanda has floated two other ideas \u2014 that of either a Madhesi leader as prime minister, or a neutral figure leading a political cabinet to hold elections. The Opposition is not in favour of either option.\nIn all of this, an additional complication is the internal politics of the Maoists. The party is holding a general convention in early February, and leaders do not want to rock the boat till then. Mr. Prachanda wishes to be elected as chairman unopposed, and making any compromise that will antagonise Mr. Bhattarai will create complications for him. Despite their flexible stance in public, the Maoist attitudes have hardened in recent days since they do not want status quo to be disturbed till then.\n\nDeadlines\n\nThe President\u2019s third deadline to the parties to come up with a prime ministerial candidate ends on Wednesday. Dr. Yadav has got into a self-made trap. He cannot backtrack, but neither can he take any other step for in the absence of a parliament, there is no other way to select a prime minister. He has already flirted dangerously with constitutional limits, and will create a new crisis with any unilateral move.\nUnless political and constitutional hurdles are cleared by December-end, the EC has ruled out elections in April. If they are not held in spring, the political deadlock could continue through all of next year with the monsoon, harvest season, festival cycles and winter hampering the election schedule.\nWith their failure to draft a constitution, the relentless power games, abysmal governance, and fractured party organisations, all Nepali political forces appear to be scared of returning to the voter. But there is no alternative but to seek popular mandate to resolve the current crisis, and restore legitimacy to the post-2006 framework. The onus lies largely on the Opposition to shed its singular obsession with the prime minister\u2019s chair, and partly on the Maoists to not let their internal party matters hold the country hostage. The focus instead should be on how to create conditions for free and fair elections in spring 2013.\n\n\nThe Opposition\u2019s insistence on changing the Prime Minister, without offering\n\n\n\n\na compelling political road map, is at the heart of the impasse in Kathmandu\n\n\n"

A positive feature is that implementation of the final award will involve the formation of a Cauvery Management Board to regulate the supply of water and a Water Regulation Committee, which will post representatives in each of the eight reservoirs in the basin States, to ensure that the decisions are carried out. Giving finality to the award through the notification may help take the issue away from politics, and place it in the hands of a technical, expert body. Of course, depoliticising an issue that involves two principal antagonists is no easy task. The February 2007 award has been questioned by way of clarification petitions before the Tribunal itself as well as suits in the Supreme Court by both parties and sceptics may wonder how useful the gazette notification may be now. The parties are still free to pursue their clarification petitions and appeals, but in the larger interest of a long-term solution and to end seasonal acrimony, they would do well to give the award a chance.\nThe fact that notifying the award has been a long-pending demand of Tamil Nadu should not make one believe that the action redounds to one party\u2019s benefit to the detriment of the other. It was the Supreme Court that made the suggestion that the final decision be notified and counsel for all the basin states have agreed that it could be done. It may be argued that gazetting the award will not resolve the present standoff over judicial and administrative directives to Karnataka to release water to save standing crops in Tamil Nadu. The Cauvery Monitoring Committee, while asking Karnataka to ensure 12 thousand million cubic feet of water to Tamil Nadu in December, has itself admitted that its decision is unlikely to satisfy either party, given that both States have less water in their reservoirs than in previous years. Yet, it has opted for a pragmatic solution under which both States will be in deficit of approximately 47 tmcft. It is in the same spirit of pragmatism that both States must now approach the larger problem of sharing water as per a judicially determined solution in both normal and distress years. The two should not let posterity say of them that long after equitable distribution has entrenched itself as the most acceptable doctrine in riverine jurisprudence, they did not allow a judicially determined system for sharing to work.\n"

The protesters\u2019 case is strengthened by the fact that election officials put the turnout at 43 per cent, which is itself much lower than the usual 60 per cent. The opposition parties also contend that the changed law gerrymanders the result in favour of pro-government candidates; the government, on the other hand, says the result enables better cooperation between the executive and the legislature \u2014 but the Emir appoints the Council of Ministers, of whom 16 also sit in the Majles. For the record, the parties which boycotted the election have been hit hard. In addition, the three largest Bedouin tribes, which had as many as 17 seats in previous assemblies, now have only one. Second, the new assembly will contain 17 members of the minority Shia community, who form 30 per cent of the 1.2 million native Kuwaiti population; three women have won seats, but four of the earlier assembly were women.\nThe recent developments constitute a key development in the Kuwaiti people\u2019s campaign for democracy, which predates the Arab Spring by five years or so. The Kuwaiti public have for some time shown what they think, with demonstrations which had swelled to 50,000 people by November 2011; their suspicions deepened when, in June 2012, the constitutional court annulled the February elections, in which Islamist opposition candidates had won up to 34 seats, and reinstated the earlier parliament; subsequent protests numbered 100,000. The reinstated body tried to meet in July and August, but a majority of members stayed away. Furthermore, the leading opposition politician Mussallam al-Barak was arrested for \u201cundermining the status of the Emir\u201d by criticising him in public. Mr. al-Barak was given bail, but faces a potential five-year jail term. The ruling al-Sabah family appears to be avoiding the full political implications of the current unrest; the Emir\u2019s replacement of the Prime Minister, a relative, with another relative will not convince the public. Neither will the $108-bn plan to diversify the oil-dependent economy assuage the demands for political reform. The Kuwaiti public rightly demand genuine representative democracy, and given that democracy has penetrated deeper in Kuwait than it has done in many other Gulf countries, a constitutional monarchy would be a pioneering and constructive creation.\n"

For both the Australian and U.S. policymakers, adopting and shaping the \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d as a geostrategic category helps them resolve their key domestic and foreign policy dilemmas while maintaining their positions in the global order as a great power and middle power respectively.\n\nFitting in India\n\nBut how does India fit into this emerging concept? While India supports a basic adherence to international law, freedom of navigation and peaceful dispute settlement, it is increasingly clear that its preferred regional architecture in the \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d will be shaped by the demands of its domestic economic restructuring and its continuing adherence to the principle of strategic autonomy.\nFor this reason, any assumption that India will sign up to an Indo-Pacific security architecture devised in Washington and Canberra fundamentally misreads the domestic political projects that animate India\u2019s own vision of the Indo-Pacific.\nTo see how different domestic imperatives lead to distinctive Indo-Pacific regional constructions, we can examine some of the major regional initiatives that have recently been promoted by the U.S., Australia and India.\n\nLeaving out China\n\nThe U.S. has recently launched the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a free trade initiative that does not involve China and includes trade, investment, intellectual property, health care, environmental and labour standards. It has also called for a \u201cregional architecture of institutions and arrangements to enforce international norms on security, trade, rule of law, human rights, and accountable governance\u201d in the Indo-Pacific region.\nThese regional initiatives are built on the promotion of regulatory frameworks in the Indo-Pacific \u2014 in areas such as intellectual property rights \u2014 that serve domestic political and economic agendas, namely increasing the competitiveness of the American economy and maintaining U.S. prominence as a global rule-setter. It is thus central to emerging geo-economic competition over the regulation and rules of the regional and global political economy.\n\nThe Australian bridge\n\nAustralia, meanwhile, is attempting to act as a classic middle power bridge between the East and West by balancing its commitment to a U.S.-driven framework of rules and regulations with the knowledge that its economic future is increasingly intertwined with Asia and China, in particular.\nTo manage these growing tensions, it has encouraged the U.S. pivot to the Indo-Pacific while advocating greater political, economic and strategic enmeshment between the U.S. and China and refocusing its attention on the Indian Ocean Rim-Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC). Australia has also welcomed both the U.S.-centred TPP as well as the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)-centred Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).\nThe RCEP includes China and focuses on a narrower set of issues than the TPP, excluding issues such as labour standards, which would deter China from ascension. Despite the differences between the two schemes, Australia regards the TPP and RCEP as complementary pathways to a regional free trade area and has vowed to promote the inclusion of elements such as environmental and labour standards during RCEP negotiations. Despite embracing the Indo-Pacific concept, India is not a member of the TPP but has joined the RCEP. The TPP\u2019s rigid objectives of regulatory coherence do not fit with India\u2019s stated desire for a \u201cplural, inclusive and open security architecture in the Indo-Pacific\u201d and India has long resisted the inclusion of non-trade related provisions in multilateral trade negotiations. RCEP\u2019s provisions for \u201cthe different levels of development of the participating countries\u201d and ASEAN\u2019s emphasis on consensual decision-making are far more conducive to the type of regional architecture that India desires, since they are more congruent with its domestic imperatives of development and autonomy. This suggests the contested nature of the Indo-Pacific.\nDomestic imperatives also drive India\u2019s increased attention to regional groupings like the IOR-ARC and smaller, more specialised forums that deal with issues like piracy, energy and food security. These initiatives focus on non-traditional security issues, which India sees as posing the most significant external threat to its economic development. This bottom-up, issue-driven approach to Indo-Pacific regionalism may prove, over the long run, to be more sustainable than the elite-driven regional projects that were the hallmark of Asia-Pacific regionalism.\nHence, a new \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d era may well be dawning. But the adoption of the concept in the foreign policy debates and vocabularies of India, Australia and the United States reflect a heightened focus in all three countries on domestic political and economic challenges rather than a strategic convergence or a common regional vision.\n\n(Priya Chacko is at the University of Adelaide and the author of Indian Foreign Policy: The Politics of Postcolonial Identity from 1947 to 2004, Routledge, 2012.)\n\n\nMore than a common regional vision,\n\n\n\n\nthe distinctive domestic and foreign policy priorities of the U.S, Australia and India\n\n\n\n\nare driving their new attention to\n\n\n\n\nthe \u2018Indo-Pacific\u2019 as a geostrategic category\n\n\n"

An associate company of Apollo Hospitals Enterprises Ltd., AHS is a leading provider of healthcare business services and world-class health information technology (HIT)-based solutions.\nDilip Vellodi, Founder Chairman & CEO of Sutherland Global Services, told this correspondent that the deal would be consummated by February since it had to get regulatory clearances. \u201cWith Christmas round the corner, we expect the transaction to close by February,\u201d he said in a telephone conversation.\nSutherland, Mr. Vellodi said, had been focusing on healthcare as a key vertical, and investing heavily in the last few years. \u201cHealthcare market is a sizable business in the U.S., and in some parts of Europe,\u201d he pointed out. In the U.S., especially, the healthcare market was growing due to aging population, and the need to compulsorily provide healthcare insurance (thanks to President Obama), he said.\nThe acquisition would help Sutherland become a leading healthcare service provider with comprehensive information technology and business process integrated solutions, and consolidate its presence as a dominant player in the $38 billion U.S. healthcare BPO market, he said.\nEstablished in 1986, Sutherland offers an integrated portfolio of analytics-driven back-office and customer-facing solutions that support the entire customer life-cycle. It is one of the largest, independent BPO companies in the world serving global leaders in major industry verticals.\nThe company has over 30,000 employees globally, working out of 35 operations centres in the U.S., the Philippines, India, the UAE, Egypt, Bulgaria, the U.K., Canada, Jamaica, Mexico, and Colombia.\nApollo Health Street provides customised strategic support services to more than 150 healthcare partners throughout the U.S. from 10 global operational centres of excellence.\nMr. Vallodi said Apollo Health Street had presence in major American cities such as California, New Jersey, Florida and Georgio. \u201cChennai has been our headquarters for Asia-Pacific region,\u201d he said. With the acquisition of Apollo Health Street, \u201cwe will now have a base in Hyderabad as well,\u201d he added.\nTo a question, he said technology- and platform-based solutions did not require any linear addition to human resources base. Sutherland, he said, was confident of maintaining its 20 per cent growth rate in the coming year as well. In this context, he said Sutherland was confident of scaling revenue of $900 million in 2013. The healthcare vertical\u2019s contribution to the total revenue would be around 15 per cent in 2013, he added. To a query, he said it did not make sense to have two companies functioning in the same vertical. Hence, he indicated that Apollo Health Street would be integrated into the healthcare practice of Sutherland.\nTo drive Apollo Health Street to the next stage of its evolution, it was essential to find the right strategic partner, a statement quoted Prathap C. Reddy, Founder Chairman of Apollo Hospitals, as saying. \u201cIn Sutherland, we found the ideal partner with a proven track record of excellence in services, technology, and leadership. The combined capabilities of both companies will create a compelling value proposition for our clients,\u201d he was quoted as further saying.\n"

Mr. Moily clarified that CAG had not asked Petroleum Ministry to withhold approvals to RIL.\nHowever, CAG had recommended that pending complete submission of all supporting records by the operators of Panna-Mukta-Tapti (PMT) and KG-D6 relating to expenditure for previous years up to 2011-12 and comprehensive and detailed scrutiny thereof to verify that government\u2019s financial interests have not been adversely affected in any way, the Ministry may examine all relevant issues closely and carefully before considering the \u201cdesirability of any further approvals\u201d of capital expenditure through the annual work programme and budget, development plans or otherwise, except those of an emergent nature.\nMr. Moily said that the government had directed the contractor (RIL) to provide access to all records, accounts, documents of the block to CAG as per Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and extant legal framework.\nSimilarly, officials in the Ministry said CAG would restrict its audit in the case of KG D6 to financial audit of RIL and the performance audit of Petroleum Ministry and DGH. \u201cCAG has sent us a communication that the audit of Block KG-D6 will be strictly as per Section 1.9 of the accounting procedure to the production sharing contract (PSC).

The CAG has also made it abundantly clear that the audit would not be for internal consumption, as demanded by RIL, and the report would be presented to Parliament for scrutiny. \u201cThrough direct performance audit of Ministry/DGH, CAG will indirectly speak about the performance of the KG-D6 and also scrutinise various issues pertaining to it and make comments on the way government handled the whole situation pertaining to RIL,\u201d the official added.\nOfficials in the government were also of the view that this might not be the end of confrontation between CAG and RIL and the government auditor could seek various documents relating to tendering process followed for buying equipment or in selection of service providers, something which RIL was unlikely to grant access to. The CAG is also likely to examine whether government\u2019s profit take from KG-D6 and its subsidy output on power and fertiliser increased on account of use of imported LNG due to KG-D6 output of just 23 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) not matching the projected profile of 80 mmscmd.\n\n\nSeeks withholding of approvals,\n\n\n\n\nsays Moily\n\n\n"

The scheme, which would be rolled out for 51 districts from January 1, involves the government transferring cash subsidy of Rs. 520.50 into the bank accounts of LPG consumers and asking them to buy their LPG at the market price of Rs. 931 per cylinder.\nAt present, oil marketing companies are selling LPG at a subsidised rate of Rs. 410.50 per cylinder in Delhi. This led to subsidised LPG being diverted to unintended use such as commercial establishments, who are otherwise supposed to buy gas at market price.\n\u201cThe cash transfer would not be easy as Aadhar penetration is very low. Only 20 crore people have been enrolled for Aadhaar, out of the total population . Rolling out direct cash transfer in districts where Aadhaar penetration is less than 80-90 per cent would be difficult. We cannot make Aadhaar for cash transfers as the basis in such places,\u201d he remarked.\nThe direct cash transfer for LPG would be first implemented in 20 districts and the remaining 31 districts would be covered in February or March. \u201cEarlier UIDAI had said they would reach 80 per cent penetration in the 31 districts by April but now they say they would expedite the process, so may be in February the scheme in those districts can be launched,\u201d he added.\nAlso officials in the Petroleum Ministry said another problem likely to be faced in implementation of the scheme would be the inadequate coverage of banking services in these districts.\nMr. Chaturvedi also disclosed that India would unveil its new shale gas exploration policy by month-end, in an attempt to exploit the unconventional hydrocarbon resource. \u201cWe will come out with a shale gas policy by the end of December.

Despite this, if you continue with the detention order, we reserve our right, including the right to claim such damages and other compensation from your Department that we may suffer,\u201d the airline\u2019s CFO A.

No authority has any right whatsoever to detain aircraft owned by overseas lessors,\u201d the airlines spokesperson said.\nMeanwhile, it was reported that Etihad Airways would pick up a controlling stake in Kingfisher Airlines. But the airline, in a filing to the BSE, clarified that it was in discussion with various investors, including Etihad Airways, for equity investment in the company. \u201cHowever, no agreement has been reached either with Etihad or any other airline, and the matter is merely at a negotiation stage,\u201d Kingfisher said.\n"

            "body": "After India won the first Test of this series comfortably, it appeared to be on the verge of embarrassing England in conditions which have proved challenging before.\nTwo Test matches later, India is looking down the barrel of another series loss that will be even more galling than losing to England and Australia abroad. How has India lost its way so badly?\nHaving struggled in the UAE against Pakistan earlier in the year, England was forced to reconsider the makeup of its team and the way it approached playing cricket in the sub-continent.\nEngland did not get the balance of the team right in Ahmedabad, but since then it has shown a single-minded focus on doing what needed to be done. It committed itself to hard work and was prepared to make tough selection decisions.\nIndia, on the other hand, has distracted itself by focusing on the type of pitches that it wanted rather than doing the hard work required to finish off an opponent which was on the ropes. Rather than insisting on spin-friendly surfaces, India would have been better advised to work hard on the basics of its game.\nThe Indians would do well to heed the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita which urges one to do one\u2019s duty with no anticipation of the result, and without succumbing to inaction.\nFor many weeks now it seems that an inordinate amount of time and energy has been invested in what type of pitch India needs to have presented to it. If all that time and energy had been spent on preparation and planning, the results in the last two Test matches may have been very different.\n\nUnedifying\n\nIt was unedifying to witness the battle between the captain and Prabir Mukherjee over what type of pitch was wanted for the Eden Gardens Test match.\nInstead of the impassioned battle in the media, time spent on developing a group with a passion for a tough contest may have yielded better results.\nI agree with Mukherjee who was quoted as saying \u201cGames should be decided by the quality of the player, not the pitch.\u201d Mukherjee held a mirror up to the Indian team\u2019s mindset and the resultant reflection told a tale of a team focused on the wrong things.\nIn my experience, worrying about things that are not core issues is a poor use of time and energy. It would have been far better to focus on doing the basics well. That is; bowl with discipline, bat with patience and perseverance, catch everything that should be caught, save singles and make some run-outs.\nThese are the principles that successful cricket teams swear by.\nEngland has done this better than India in two of the three Test matches so far and is consequently leading in the series.\nIndia on the other hand, has been distracted by focusing on the pitch conditions rather than mentally preparing for the Tests. If the captain is distracted, you can bet the rest of the team will be.\n\nBack to basics\n\nThe Indian team needs to go back to basics and let the groundsmen worry about the type of pitches to prepare. Most pitches in India are going to spin at some stage or the other anyway, so best to focus on making sure the team is primed for the battle.\nFitness and fielding are two areas that have been bugbears of Indian teams for decades. If the players are not prepared to work hard enough in these areas, then they should not be selected.\nTalent is one thing, but hard work is an imperative ingredient of success.\nIt is better to have a team that is going to leave no stone unturned to win than a bunch of individuals who think that they have earned the right to play based on previous performance.\nCurrent form and commitment are critical components.\nTest cricket, as the name implies, is more than a test of which team has the most talent. Desire, passion, courage and the will to fight to the death are paramount.\nOn paper there is not much between these two teams. The difference is that England has been the more committed to doing whatever needs to be done to finish on top.\nApart from batting and bowling better, it is much fitter and it has worked much harder on the field. This will have proven to be the difference unless India changes its mindset and focuses on the type of cricket that it plays, rather than the type of pitch that it plays on.\nThe selectors have made their move. Now it is up to the players to play with pride and passion.\nIt is not enough just to be in the team. Each individual must want to be the one to make a difference.\n\n\nEngland committed itself to hard work and was prepared to make tough selection decisions, says Greg Chappell\n\n\n"

            "body": "Cricket is priority at Jamtha, on the outskirts of this growing city. This excellent venue promises to set up a fierce contest from Thursday, on which India must win to square the series.\nThe curator, former Vidarbha all-rounder Praveen Hingnikar, has been gagged by the Board. He would officially speak on the fifth day.\n\nNormally a good pitch\n\nThe pitch here is normally a good one. There is bounce and that ensures good cricket.\nEngland off-spinner Graeme Swann, with those sensational dismissals of Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar in the last Test, was realistic when asked about the pitch.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you believe. The pitch is going to be the pitch whatever happens on Thursday morning.\n\u201cI am sure the management and coach will look at it and they will assess it. We play on it whatever comes on,\u201d was his measured response.\nBut the playing surface remains a point of interest for both camps.\nThe surface is dry but reflects cracks beneath. The bounce should give the bowlers an advantage even though it is just the pitch that would thrill stroke-players like Virat Kohli, Sehwag and Tendulkar, who like the ball to come on to the bat.\nTendulkar made a quick dash to the middle, practiced his routine shadow play on the pitch, and must have drawn up his battle plans. Mahendra Singh Dhoni later took a tour of the pitch along with Hingnikar.\nIshant Sharma spent time with the bowling coach, working on his in-swinger and length ball.\nThe fast bowlers has strayed wildly, and landed short, and was punished for his errors. It is time Ishant delivered, especially after winning the faith of the selectors.\nSwann spoke of dominating the first session.\n\u201cWhatever the pitch is, we have to try and win the game. So come Thursday morning it will be about winning the first session, something which we have managed to do in the last two Test matches and it is why we have gone on to win the match.\u201d\n\u201cWe have really tried to embrace India and embrace the series. We believe we can win it and I am not sure that has always been the case. It may have been.\n\u201cI have only been on one Test tour before but there certainly seems to be more belief in this group right from the outset.\u201d\nThe England off-spinner put things in perspective.\n\u201cWhat I said at the start of the tour is that if you expect just the spinners to win the game for you, you are doomed. And I stand by it completely because it is a team effort.\n\u201cWithout the monumental performances of (Alastair) Cook, (Kevin) Pietersen and (Jonathan) Trott (in the last game) we would not have been 2-1 up.\u201d The emphasis clearly is on a collective assault.\n\nNothing wrong\n\nThere was nothing wrong in the home captain demanding a pitch of his choice, according to Swann.\n\u201cIt is not strange for a home team to ask for a wicket to suit their team. We do that in England because we want it to suit our bowlers.\nIndia also believes it can win but has not been able to identify the flaws and plug them in time.\nBelief is what the Indians have lacked immensely, losing the contest in the dressing room itself.\nThe stint that Ishant had on Tuesday was an indication of the desperation that the team is experiencing.\nVirat concentrated on leaving the deliveries more than play them straight at nets.\nThe one-armed Gurudas Raut, a 25-year-old seamer, at the India nets attracted the attention of many.\nHandicapped at birth, he has chased his dream to play cricket.\nHe impressed Kohli, Dhoni and Sehwag when he bowled to them during the World Cup nets here.\n\u201cI bowled Dhoni with an inswing,\u201d Raut remembered with pride. His spirit is an epic tale of inspiration. The Indian team would do well to borrow some of it for their fight at Jamtha.\n"

The French lad, ranked fifth in the world, showing flair with some eye-catching smashes, played his cards right until Zhendong caught up close to the finish of game one.\nFan, one peg below in the pecking order at sixth, then turned things his way in a sign of things to come. There was no looking back thereafter for Zhendong, who claimed the contest in clinical fashion.\nDown 0-2, the French resistance came in the form of Enzo Angles, refusing to let anything go without a fight. Facing World No.18 Fan Shengpeng, Angles, listed eight places below, showed no trace of fear or awe. After the duo had won two games each, Enzo flubbed a few returns but let his flowing forehand loop drive fall like a sledge hammer, which not only forced the pace but in the end the verdict too.\nOn the distaff side, Petrissa Solja of Germany seemed prone to error when flipping the ball over for her back hand drives against China\u2019s Gu Yuting. The battle between the left-handers was nonetheless fast, four to five exchanges at the most often settling the point. Solja however stayed ahead through the contest and presently put the issue beyond doubt at 3-1.\nAiming too deep perhaps, Theresa Kraft\u2019s forehand loop drives went beyond bounds time and again giving Zhu Yu Ling a fair measure of comfort in winning the first two games at 4 and 2. Game three appeared to be fought more keenly, with Kraft getting as far as 6.\nVariety in service gave Anja Schuh the early edge against Gu Ruochen. One down the line effort caught the Chinese lass completely out of place. Such flaws were soon to be ironed out and Gu breezed to 11-6 in the opening game.\nLargely through diagonal and cross court returns, the German regained control in game two, claiming it 11-7.\nMembers of the German squad seated behind, quite demonstrative with their support, rose from their chairs each time Schuh scored a point, lustily cheering and applauding her, in contrast to the sober and subdued Chinese camp.\nAnja put her best foot forward perhaps in the decider but couldn\u2019t muster enough momentum to dislodge her rival.\nAfter China went up 2-1, the Germans fielded their top gun Petrissa Solja, this time pitted against Zhu Yu Ling. The huge chasm separating China from the rest of the world was in evidence as Petrissa gave it her all, which sadly wasn\u2019t enough as Zhu walked away with the honours in straight games, hardly stretched by her opponent.\n\nThe results: Junior Boys: Semifinals: China bt France 3-1 (Zhendong Fan bt Simon Gauzy 11-9, 11-5, 11-2, Gaoyuan Lin bt Tristan 11-9, 11-8, 11-9, Shenpeng Fan lost to Enzo Angles 11-9, 8-11, 11-8, 10-12, 12-14, Zhendong Fan bt Tristan Flore 11-9, 11-9, 11-3).\nJapan bt South Korea 3-1 (Masaki Hoshida bt Deokhwa Choi 11-7, 11-3, 11-3, Yuto Muramatsu bt Woojin Jang 13-11, 11-4, 5-=11, 4-11, 13-11, Asuka Sakai lost to Minhyeok Kim 11-9, 9-11, 5-11, 5-11, Yuto Muramatsu bt Deokhwa Choi 10-12, 11-9, 13-11, 11-6).\n\nQuarterfinals: South Korea bt Hong Kong 3-0.

This clause was found to be restricting the potential candidates and was also in violation of the National Sports Development Code 2011. It was also observed that the election to the post of treasurer was also in contravention of the Department of Personnel & Training\u2019s circular dated 22-4-1994,\u201d said the release.\nThe federation was asked to amend its constitution and hold fresh elections to the three posts.\nSources said the ministry had sent a show cause notice to the AFI following the September 13 Delhi High Court order that came in a writ petition filed by lawyer-activist Rahul Mehra.\nMehra had challenged the elections on several grounds, but most importantly on the \u2018restrictive clause\u2019 that tried to prevent new entrants from contesting, in his argument.\nThe court ordered that the government look into the arguments put forward by Mehra and ensure that elections were held as per rules and the Sports Code.\nThe court stated that in case the elections were found not to be in conformity with the code then no recognition should be granted and the ministry would also enforce the sanctions arising out of the consequences.\nBoth AFI and Mehra were given hearings by the ministry before the process was completed to issue a directive.\nThe court had asked the government to give a \u2018reasoned order\u2019 on the matter.\nAdille Sumariwalla, who was elected president at the April elections, and C.K. Valsan, elected secretary last time, are expected to contest again.\nTreasurer Satyanarayana, a Railway employee, had not taken permission from his employer before contesting, as required under the Central Civil Services (Conduct) rules. He had reportedly informed the federation that he was not in a position to continue even before the government action came.\nThat there is no immediate suspension of the federation and only a de-recognition threat if corrective measures were not taken has come as a relief to the athletes.\nEven otherwise, the ministry had recently made it clear that it would not allow athletes to suffer because of any action initiated against any federation.\nAlternative mechanisms for providing support to athletes, were being put in place, the Sports Minister, Jitendra Singh, had assured.\nThe AFI had already indicated that it was ready for amending its constitution and holding fresh elections.\nIt was one among 20-odd National federations controlling Olympic sports that had agreed, at least in principle, to the Sports Code more than a year ago.\n"

At that time his knock was second only to the Australian\u2019s 452 not out in first-class cricket.\nThat innings still remains the fourth-highest individual score in first-class cricket. He was unable to break the record because, with the total at 826 for four at lunch, the other side conceded the match. Later, Bradman sent a personal note to Nimbalkar saying he considered the Indian\u2019s innings better than his own.\nBorn on December 12, 1919, Nimbalkar played for various teams like Baroda, Holkar, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Railways.\nAn aggregate of 3,687 runs at a healthy average of 56.72 with 11 centuries marked him out as one of the outstanding batsmen in the Ranji Trophy. Nimbalkar had 58 wickets in his domestic career which spanned from 1939-40 to 1964-65, and also kept wickets in some matches.\nA prolific run-getter, Nimbalkar, in his 80-match first-class career, scored 4,577 runs at an average of 52.01 with 12 centuries.\nThough, he never represented India in an official Test, he played for the country once \u2014 against the first Commonwealth team in 1949-50, scoring 48.\nAcknowledged by many as a batsman cast in the mould of Vijay Hazare and Vijay Merchant, Nimbalkar had his early education at the Model School in Kolhapur, and captained the school team at the age of 15. He moved to Baroda to be with his brother, Raosaheb Nimbalkar, who shaped his first-class cricket career.\nNimbalkar made his Ranji Trophy debut in 1939 against Baroda. He achieved stardom playing for Holkar under C.K. Nayudu. He scored 178 against Bengal in 1942.

For, with colleges in Kottayam, Kannur and Kozhikode frequently grabbing the talent that kept showing up at the Kalloor centre, Wynad did not take a big leap forward.\n\nFocus on grassroots\n\nBut two years ago, Sultan Bathery\u2019s St. Mary\u2019s College and School started a new academy and brought in Ashokan, a former Wynad captain, as its coach.\nGirls from the eighth standard and up to plus two levels were picked, given free boarding, lodging and training throughout the year. The stress was on the grassroots-level and the plan was to make the academy as a feeder centre for the St. Mary\u2019s College in the long run.\nIt is now churning out impressive results for the district too. The Wynad girls won the State junior, sub-junior and mini championships over the last few weeks, with the mini title coming at Kondotty in Malappuram on Sunday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time, we are winning so many State titles in a season,\u201d said Ashokan.\nAnd the girls suddenly find home attractive. \u201cNow, our children want to stay here because they see a future in St. Mary\u2019s College and in Wynad. And the college management takes good care of them because it looks at these girls as future stars of its team,\u201d said Ashokan who coaches 32 girls at the centre.\n\u201cLast year, 14 children from Wynad represented the State at the Nationals. The number has gone up to nearly 20 this year.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to come now because of the long distance from Wynad to colleges in Kottayam and other districts,\u201d said Anilkumar, the volleyball coach at Changanassery\u2019s Assumption College.\nUnlike colleges and schools which look for ready-made stars, the St. Mary\u2019s centre searches for raw talent. \u201cAnd we always search for girls with height,\u201d explained Ashokan.\nAnd it\u2019s very clear\u2026the Wynad girls are getting taller!\n"

In Sweden, surgeons reported having implanted a patient with a vein grown from the patient\u2019s own stem cells. A kidney like organ was grown in a lab in Italy and shown to work for animals.\nAustrian researchers developed a quantum computer capable of performing calculations without revealing any of the data involved. This would help in cryptography. Later IBM demonstrated a qubit microchip which could hold the data for a long time. Researchers also developed a power crystal quantum computer with 300 atoms.\nAmerican researchers \u201ccloak\u201d a three dimensional object making it invisible to some parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in the microwave region.\nNow under construction are 3D printers\u2013 Dutch doctors fit a jaw that was made with a 3D printer on to an 83-year old woman. The D-Shape Robotic Building System constructed a full-sized house. American engineers have built a 3D printer which can make tools out of lunar or Martian rock.\nA longstanding search for a fundamental particle called the Higgs boson arrived at a climax. Scientists at CERN cautiously announced the experimental discovery of a Higgs-like boson. It was theoretically predicted nearly fifty years ago.\nDutch scientists report sighting of the Majorana particle which was theoretically predicted in the 1930s by the Italian scientist Ettore Majorana. This is important because the particle is its own antiparticle (unlike the electron whose antiparticle is the positron).\nSignificant advances were made in HIV/AIDS research. First, U.S. researchers announced a possible cure using a drug used in cancer treatment. Canadian researchers made significant progress towards an AIDS vaccine. Their trials showed a boosting of immunity levels and no adverse effects.\nIn the early part of the year there was bad news for malaria research, in that a new drug-resistant strain was reported in the Thai-Cambodian border. But later, as if to balance it, came the claim from South African researchers that they have a breakthrough drug that cures all strains of malaria.\nNeutrinos were in the news throughout the year. First, because a team mistakenly reported that they could show neutrinos travelled faster than light.\nThis was later disproved.\nThere was another group that sent a neutrino \u201cmessage\u201d through 780 feet of rock.\nThough this is in the nascent stages, it could develop into technology for interstellar communication, given how weakly neutrinos interact.\nAstronomers discovered the first rectangle-shaped galaxy LEDA 074886.\nRobotics has advanced to a great degree. A paralysed woman used a bionic mobility suit to run a marathon \u2013 The London Marathon \u2013 in 16 days.

More often than not, we start with one topic, click a few links and within no time are reading about something else. Qwikipedia is a game that tries to quench this curiosity in us.\nThe objective is to get to a particular wiki page, starting from a specific article, using minimal clicks. There is no single correct answer, so we might surprise ourselves by finding new routes each time!\n\nWednesday\u2019s Wanderer\n\nBaker\u2019s dozen \u2014> Foot (unit)\n\nBaker\u2019s dozen\n\nAs we all know a dozen is a grouping of twelve. But in usage there are two exceptions to this: the baker\u2019s dozen and the decimal dozen. While a baker\u2019s dozen consists of a group of thirteen, a decimal dozen has only ten in its collection. Bakers used to be watched strictly in many societies because they were believed to cheat their customers by giving them less. So to counter this, bakers started giving one extra loaf of bread for every dozen ordered, so that effectively one would get 13 pieces for every dozen ordered!\n\nDozen\n\nA dozen is a collection of 12 similar items. It is a very convenient and interesting grouping. Considering we use the decimal system when it comes to most measurements and in science, it is interesting that our ancestors found the grouping in 12 very useful and handy. This is perhaps due to the properties of number 12.\n\nNumber 12\n\nTwelve is the smallest number with six divisors \u2013 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. This makes it easy to use in calculations. It is widely used in fields where extensive calculations are needed as in astronomy and calendars. Time as you know is divided into units of 12. Again perhaps for ease of use, the foot which is a unit of measurement is divided into 12 inches.\n\nFoot (unit)\n\nThe foot and the metre are the basic units of length in two different systems of measurement. Today one foot is defined as equal to 0.3048 metres. But it was not always the case. The definition of a foot could be anywhere between 0.2738 metres in Belgium to 0.35724 metres in rural Bordeaux in France.\n\nSo the path that we have traversed today is:\n\nBaker\u2019s dozen \u2014> Dozen \u2014> Number 12 \u2014> Foot (unit)\nThree clicks!

He may eventually spend many years behind bars. Bo\u2019s wife Gu Kailai was held for the murder of Neil Heywood, a British businessman and a family friend. Police Chief Wang Lijun, one of Bo\u2019s loyalists helped cover up the crime but later turned against him by revealing the truth. Gu Kailai was given a suspended death sentence for murdering Neil Heywood.\nThe police arrested two young women Shaheen Dhada and Renu Srinivasan over a Facebook post that spoke about the disruption in Mumbai after the death of Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray. The arrest evoked widespread condemnation. The Press Council of India said the arrests are absurd and unconstitutional. The Supreme Court, entertaining a writ petition that challenged the provision Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, decided to examine the section\u2019s constitutional validity.\nFourteen-year-old Arun Kumar Yadav, a student of class IX at Kendriya Vidayalaya, Chandigarh, won the Doodle for Google competition this year. His artwork was displayed as Google Doodle on November 14, Children\u2019s day.\nArvind Kejriwal (44), a social activist, who joined hands with Gandhian Anna Hazare to fight corruption in the government under the banner of India Against Corruption, took the political plunge by launching a party.

            "body": "\nTurmoil in Syria\nSyria has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. Violence has become an ongoing affair in the country since March 2011.\nThe trouble started when 15 children were held and tortured for writing anti-government slogans in a city called Deraa. Initially the protests demanding the release of the children were peaceful but it took a nasty turn when the government hit back violently causing the death of civilians. What started as a demand for democracy and greater freedom turned into outrage asking for the President\u2019s ouster. Assad refuses to step down and the turmoil continues. The traumatic escalation of violence across the length and breath of the country has led International Red Cross to declare that Syria is in a state of civil war.\n\nEgypt's mess\nEgypt was ruled by Hosni Mubarak for 30 years till 2011. People felt that he was not doing enough and demanded his resignation . He was overthrown after widespread protests. Mohamed Morsy, candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood party became the country\u2019s first democratically elected president on June 16, 2012 after he won 51.73 percent vote. Due to various internal political turnarounds, Morsy seems to have gathered the ire of the court as well as of the military. Recently, Morsy opted to give himself more power which has angered the Egyptians and the protests continue.\n\nPhilippines Bopha\nTyphoon named Bopha struck Mindanao Island on December 4, bringing very high winds and heavy rain. Roofs were blown off houses and the rain led to landslides and flooding. More than 3,00,000 people were forced into evacuation centres. Food and water is becoming hard to come by and there have been reports of looting in some areas and begging in some others. TheNational Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councilsaid on December 9 that the death toll now stands at 620. Nearly 1,500 were injured and 817 missing.\n\nLeveson Enquiry\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron established the Leveson Enquiry in the wake of the phone hacking scandal of the now non-operational News of the World tabloid. It was a public enquiry led by Lord Justice Leveson who has made recommendations on the future of press regulation. Prime Minister David Cameron had reportedly promised to implement the recommendations, providing they were not \"bonkers\". But within hours, he said that he was not convinced legislation underpinning self-regulation was right. Cameron then set a strict warning asking the press to regulate themselves with the powers set out by Lord Justice Leveson.\n\nUN resolution on Sri Lanka War crimes\nThe UN Human Rights Council in March 2012 passed a resolution urging Sri Lanka to conduct a credible probe into alleged war crimes during its battle against Tamil Tiger separatists in 2009. Colombo was blamed for not holding its own investigations even after three years. After tabling the resolution, the United States said that a 47-member-council had to push it across as Sri Lanka was not acting fast. Rights groups claim that up to 40,000 civilians died in the final months of the war. The Tamil Tigers had been waging a decades-long campaign for a separate homeland for minority Tamils.\n\nSuperstorm Sandy\nThere was large-scale damage when Superstorm Sandy battered the U.S. East Coast with fierce winds and heavy rain. Several people were killed. It also caused a power plant to explode, besides uprooting trees, power lines and plunging much of Manhattan in darkness.\nOne of the biggest storms ever to hit the U.S., Sandy battered the coastline of New Jersey, with 80 mph winds, pushing seawater up by an unprecedented 3-feet in New York City. Floods inundated large number of areas in New York and New Jersey. It also flooded ground-zero, the site of the 9/11 terror attacks.\n\nKokrajhar violence\nThe clashes broke out between native Bodos and Bengali speaking Muslims in Assam in July.\nThe violence escalated so much that in a month, dozens had died and hundreds had taken shelter in relief camps. Many people including the member of the Lok Sabha from Kokrajhar blamed migrants for the violence.\nThe repercussions of the Assam violence was felt across India, inciting fears among the people from north-east. It went to the extent of mass exodus from various cosmopolitan cities.\n\nCoalgate Scam\nThe Central Government has been accused in various multi-crore scams in the recent past, the most prominent of them being the Coalgate scam. In August, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) submitted a report which criticised the UPA-II for causing a great loss (Rs.1.86-lakh crore) to the nation\u2019s treasury. The report claimed that the government did not ensure transparency in coal blocks allocation to private firms during the tenure of UPA-I (2004-09). Though the PM refuted the charges, opposition created uproar and even demanded his resignation.\n\nCauvery water sharing\nThe sharing of the Cauvery river water has always been a cause of dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for many decades now. Both the States depend heavily on the river for agriculture. Protests spark every time the issue takes centre-stage. Last week (December 7), Chairman of the Cauvery Monitoring Committee (CMC) and Water Resources Secretary D.V. Singh said that the Union government will notify the final award of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal soon. This was as per the orders of the Supreme Court, he said. Karnataka was asked to ensure that Tamil Nadu receives 12 tmcft for December. It also advised both States to be more efficient in using available water.\n\n2G Spectrum Scam\nAnother major scam that rocked the stability of the Central Government was the 2G scam. High-profiled politicians and industrialists were held responsible in this multi-crore swindle. As many as 100 witnesses appeared in court this year with regard to this case. (2G refers to Second-Generation wireless telephone technology.) During the term of UPA-1, in 2008, as many as 122 2G licenses were given away to telecom companies.\nIt was later found that the allocation was given for a preferred few on a first-come first-served basis instead of the transparent auction system. This approach brought great loss (Rs 1.76 lakh crore) to the government.\n\nKudankulam protest\nKudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) was constructed in 2001 in accordance to the agreement of India with Russia in 1988. A small port became operational in the place, located at the Idiathankarai coast, Tirunelveli, TamilNadu. The nuclear plant in Kudankulam which is set to be commissioned soon is being widely opposed by the locals who fear that radiation from the plant can affect them. The protesters are not wiling to buy the government\u2019s theory that their interests will be safeguarded.\n\nFDI\nThe UPA cleared 51 per cent FDI in multi-brand retail, which has been witnessing nationwide opposition. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is investment by foreign companies in various sectors in a target country.\nBy allowing FDI in retail, doors have been opened for giant foreign retailers to invest in India.\nAccording to those who resist it, the business of the locals will be badly hit by foreign competition.\nTrinamool Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee called the FDI as anti-people and withdrew her party's support to the UPA government.\n"

The advantage of these gases is their short-life. So if we stop emitting them, they can disappear off our atmosphere within decades.\nBlack carbon emissions can be limited by using filters in vehicles; lower level ozone by using better cooking stoves, and so on.

Its 313bhp and 66.2kgm of torque lands it right in the performance diesel arena; the engine under the hood is a twin-turbo diesel V6. The SQ5 is a big power, all-wheel drive, compact SUV. It\u2019s unfortunate this car isn\u2019t coming to India as this performance diesel suits our conditions well \u2014 it has the on-demand torque that we so require in the cut and thrust of traffic and also has the economy and running cost advantage of the cheaper fuel.\nThe SQ5 comes from Audi\u2019s \u2018S\u2019 line of cars which is their performance arm.\nPerformance, as expected, is spine-compressing. Audi claims it will hit 100kph in 5.1 seconds, and the SQ5 does nothing to make you doubt that. Floor the throttle and once past the initial bit of hesitation, it\u2019s one long, relentless surge all the way to its 250kph top speed. On the de-restricted Autobahn outside Munich, the SQ5 was simply stunning in the way it effortlessly breached 200kph, and it even had some reserve once we ran out of bravery at 240kph. Helping it along is the eight-speed torque-converter auto (a DSG can\u2019t take extended assaults from this engine\u2019s 66.2kgm of torque), with the especially long-legged eighth gear that allows fast cruising with minimum fuss.\nThere\u2019s something else that makes the SQ5 fun, and that\u2019s the sound the exhaust makes. When you dial up the \u2018Dynamic\u2019 mode on the Drive Select system, a sound actuator in the exhaust system makes this V6 sound like a V8. It\u2019s why you\u2019ll find yourself constantly pulling away from low speeds in a high gear, just to hear the cultured burble it makes.\nCredit is also due to the mildly massaged engine. This engine feels even smoother than the V6 turbo-diesel currently in the Q5 3.0TDI. The 2,967cc V6 uses twin-turbochargers connected in series via a flap. Also on the menu is the cylinder head cooling, the timing and lift of the intake cam shafts, the pistons, their oil-jet cooling and the piston pins that have been specially designed to take on the extra load. The common-rail system can run at a maximum pressure of 2,000 bar of pressure and injects as many as eight shots of fuel into the cylinders per cycle.\nAs for the way it drives, Audi\u2019s chassis development team has taken 30mm out of the regular Q5\u2019s ride height, stiffened its springs and anti-roll bars and specified new, stiffer fixed-rate dampers. The kinematics of the suspension \u2014 camber, castor and toe angles \u2014 hasn\u2019t been altered from the regular Q5.\nSo, while it remains impressively flat and unflustered through corners. The steering is a bit of a disappointment as well \u2014 it lacks progressiveness in both feedback and consistency. The SQ5, as is with most Audis, is better at straight-line thrills than corner-carving precision. That said, its tremendous grip and body control combined with that ever willing engine and aural excitement will be enough to satisfy most.\nNow, for the bits that are coming to India. Audi has given the Q5 a light mid-life facelift that will be on all Q5s sold in India towards the end of 2012. If you\u2019re wondering what\u2019s different, you need to get your magnifying glass and fine toothcomb out. The changes lie with a grille that now takes Audi\u2019s new hexagonal shape and its detailing that differ depending on what engine is under the hood. The headlights get new daytime running lamps, the bumper is new and the fog lights have chrome ring surrounds. At the rear, the tail-lamps get different LEDs and there\u2019s a new rear diffuser.\nLike the recently facelifted A4, the interiors too get subtle tweaks and improvements to uplift the general feel and finish of the cabin. Audi will also continue to offer the 2.0-litre TDI, the 3.0-litre TDI and the 2.0-litre TFSI petrol with improvements that make them slightly more powerful and smoother.\nSince its launch in 2009, the Q5 has always lived in the shadow of its big brother, the Q7. So the mild facelift and tweaks will give it a tiny but much-needed shot in the arm. But we can\u2019t help think it needs a bit more excitement. So maybe the time is ripe for the SQ5.\nPrice Rs. 60 lakh (est)\n0-100kph 5.1sec*\nTop speed 250kph*\n\nLength 4644mm\nWidth1911mm\nHeight 1624mm\n\nWheelbase 2813mm\nKerb weight 1920kg\n\nEngine 6-cyls in vee,\n2967cc, twin-turbo diesel\nInstallation Front, longitu\ndinal, all-wheel drive\nPower 313bhp at\n3900-4500rpm\nTorque 66.2kgm at 1450-\n2800rpm\n\nGearbox 8-speed auto\n\n\nIts tremendous grip and body control combined with that ever willing engine and aural excitement will be enough to satisfy most\n\n\n"

To believe that she died in penury disturbed me,\u201d said the writer, who travelled the length and breadth of the country driven by human interest. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how tawaif singers have been obliterated from national consciousness.\u201d\nDEEPA GANESH\nAt the \u201cSrujana Sheelathe - Creativity in Writing\u201d session at the BLF, some of the biggest names in Kannada literature came together to - we were told - present their thoughts on the topic. Moderated by noted film critic Manu Chakravarty, the panel featured U.R. Ananthamurthy, K.S. Nissar Ahmed, Chandrasekhar Kambar, and Vaidehi. In his opening remarks, Chakravarty contended that creativity in the act of writing took more than one form: one that was less acknowledged, he said, was what he called the epistemological, political aspects of writing \u2014 it is \u201cnot only about craft, but knowledge and political choice\u201d.\nThe poet Nissar Ahmed, who is perhaps well-known to the general public for songs such as \u201cNityotsava\u201d - the \u201cunofficial state anthem of Karnataka\u201d - laughingly recalled his engagement with the idea of a \u201cpopular\u201d writer. \u201cI used to write such \u2018gambheera\u2019 (serious) poetry - and then I was compared to Rajkumar,\u201d he laughed. \u201cBut then I realised it was praise, not criticism.\u201d\nHe also broke into reciting Ghalib\u2019s poetry once or twice, much to the crowd\u2019s delight. In his remarks, U.R. Ananthamurthy chose to criticise modern ideas of \u2018development\u2019 \u2014 pointing out that roads and flyovers do not translate into better lives; and that spending on education is not high. Perhaps the two most lively and engaging responses came from the next two writers. In a spirited speech, Vaidehi, a Sahitya Akademi Awardee, pointed out that \u2018feminism\u2019 has always been present, and wasn\u2019t invented in recent centuries; women\u2019s struggles had always been ongoing, even though they aren\u2019t always represented in history. When she sits down to write, a number of stories that she has heard, come to her, she said.\nChandrasekhar Kambar had the audience in splits with his accounts of his childhood home, on the banks of the Ghataprabha river.\nThey would often see bodies floating down, and would invent stories about what might have happened. His stories would be such that they would come back to him by the afternoon!\nWe were eager to hear about the individual creative processes of these accomplished writers: the everyday and banal aspects of writing, and how they dealt with them \u2014 that didn\u2019t come across. Time constraints meant writers had to be rushed through their sessions, as well, with no conversation between themselves.\nNEHA MUJUMDAR\nDespite the session getting rescheduled because moderator Boria Majumdar\u2019s flight got hideously delayed, \u201cPlaying the Write Game\u201d was not plagued by any sort of inertia. Things got off to a cheerful start with the launch of Boria\u2019s book Cooking on the Run: An Average Indian Man\u2019s Encounters with Food . Boria set the ball rolling when he asked if one would be politically correct while writing about sports and sportspeople.\nShehan Karunatilaka who has written the mesmerizing Chinaman candidly commented \u201cI was writing fiction, I was looking for gossip. I was making up a story about a drunk and cricket.\u201d\nBoria asked cricket writer Vedam Jaishankar how difficult it was to write Rahul Dravid\u2019s biography. Vedam said he has followed Dravid\u2019s progress since he was a child and Dravid \u201chas never put a foot wrong\u201d.\nBoria talked about the Indian habit of deifying personalities. He drew a comparison with Andre Agassi\u2019s autobiography Open which did well because it was open about Agassi\u2019s life.\nShehan said, \u201cIn the subcontinent, the tabloid culture is not as evolved. I had lawyers look at Chinaman to see if I could get into trouble. The lawyers said libel is difficult to prove, it is good for sales and to go to court for libel, a man would have to own up to being the hard-drinking womaniser in the book!\u201d\nVedam commented there is an unsaid \u201clakshman rekha\u201d that one doesn\u2019t cross. Other panellists \u2014 athlete Ashwini Nachappa and manager Vinod Naidu brought their perspectives on sports writing to the table \u2014 on the stories that need to be told but aren\u2019t, and if sports reports were taken seriously and the effect it would have on the sportsperson as a brand.\nIt was a fascinating window into the world of stunning victories, crushing defeats, the pinnacles and pitfalls of fame.\nMINI ANTHIKAD-CHHIBBER\n\u201cWriting has freed my memory of the difficult life so I can recall it without pain. In a way it is fair to say I write, therefore I am,\u201d concluded Biman Nath as I took my place before the great stage. The confusion of re-scheduling coupled with the insistence of \u2018the show must go on\u2019 forced me to miss all of Manju Kapur\u2019s and most of Biman Nath\u2019s talk on \u201cExperience, Memory and Stories\u201d.\nThe rest of the panel included Kavery Nambisan, Anita Nair and author Usha K.R. who acted as moderator. Kavery, who is an author-doctor started to try and explain why she was a writer, \u201cAn ache to create,\u201d she supposed, \u201cI still have no answer.\u201d\n\u201cExperience starts from the time of birth \u2014 sounds, hunger, warmth, love, achievement \u2014 experience is made up of all these factors. It is the mix of the desire to do something and the regret of not having done that,\u201d said Kavery. She went on to illustrate what she said by reading an excerpt from her book The Hills Of Angeri .\nAccording to her, writers are able to use memory more faithfully, \u201cNo writer is aware when they draw from memory or experience; it is fused together. Memory, experience, imagination, intuition\u2026and writing involves all of it,\u201d she said.\nThe moderator didn\u2019t question or encourage dialogue but simply introduced Anita Nair who said, \u201cI came to writing as a chronicler of memories.\u201d A sheltered life and a middle class background are not the best ingredients for a creative career but as she started to chronicle the story of her village, the memories of her family members at some point she realised that the memories were great but she had to draw from experience, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a keeper of history, I was going to write a novel.\u201d\nShe read an excerpt from A Better Man , a paragraph where imagination crept in and plundered memories. Anita spoke of drawing upon the relationship she had with her grandmother, which was entirely imagined, for Ladies Coupe.\n \u201cI put myself in the shoes of my character.\u201d\nFor Mistress , what she called a roadblock because she knew very little about Kathakali she spoke to Kathakali dancers, asked their stories, pried their secrets, delve into their lives, used the power the writer has to extract their stories.\nCATHERINE RHEA ROY\n"

The action has an element of acting and something physical, and being quite passionate about literature and reading I wanted it to be a small literary ritual,\u201d says Bhavana.\nShe continues, \u201cThe structure had to be primitive and not imposing \u2014 like it had always been there, like it just sprung up from the grass. And the last layer in the process was the installation being open ended \u2014 it was a forest of beginnings to inspire young readers and writers.\u201d\nAnd celebrating the civic space was top most on their list of priorities, \u201cEspecially in a fast filling up city like Bangalore.

The first thing that comes to mind when one thinks of the Buddha is a sense of peace.\u201d\nRao\u2019s Buddhas are colourful, to say the least, whether in terms of the profile itself or the background. He paints the Buddha in bright reds and blues, greens, yellows, sometimes using sparkling dots to compose the image. Or he places the icon in a background with motifs of spiritual significance like peepal leaves, quite often lotuses, conch shells or chakras.\nSometimes he merges the image of the Buddha with the background, keeping it abstract with criss-crossing colours in geometric patterns or infused with another image, like that of the burdened earth, as he verbally puts it.\nHe also, quite literally, offers an \u201cabhishekam\u201d (the devotional practise of pouring offerings over the deity being worshipped) to the Buddha, as he lets tendrils of colours snake down onto the icon.\n\u201cIn most depictions of the Buddha, it is usually his face that is depicted. I have tried to go deeper by incorporating Buddhist symbols like the chakra and the pada, apart from studying the Tibetan Buddhist concepts on attaining nirvana,\u201d explains the artist, for whom painting is a passion.\n\u201cI like painting in my free time, I find it satisfying and soothing.\u201d\nHis largest painting (of 48\u201d x 72\u201d) in the exhibition is that of Buddha attaining nirvana, deep in meditation under the tree , palms clasped over his legs folded in the lotus pose.\n\u201cBuddha The Great\u201d will be on view today at Gallery 4, Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath, Kumara Krupa Road.

            "body": "When a colleague reverentially said, \u201cI will finish my leave and get back to work on Thalaivar\u2019s birthday,\u201d the reference is accepted without murmur. Because if you are even faintly acquainted with Tamil films, \u2018Thalaivar\u2019 (leader) can only mean one man: Rajnikanth. And just like the old feint of fingers and a cigarette sailing into his lips, Rajnikanth\u2019s 62nd birthday too comes with its sense of mystique on 12-12-12.\nThe Rajnikanth-phenomenon has long been accepted in South India, while north of the Vindhyas, there has been a gradual warming up over the last few years, though television anchors often fail to fathom the hysteria his movies unleash. \u201cOh he has always been big here just that you are recognising it now,\u201d said Kamal Hassan once when asked by an entertainment correspondent from a Delhi studio. Kamal Hassan, Rajnikanth\u2019s celluloid rival but a friend in real-life, was stating a fact.\nTo fathom the delirium that grips his fans, head to a theatre that plays a Rajnikanth movie. Coins, flowers, and tickets are flung in the air and at times camphor is lit when the opening credits roll. And once he appears on screen, with a half-smile and mouths a punch-dialogue, cover your ears as the guy just might launch into a guttural scream. Perhaps you could have a word with the Japanese tourists, who make a beeline to see Rajnikanth\u2019s home especially after being enamoured with The Dancing Maharaja as his 1995 flick Muthu was known in Tokyo.\nIt is not difficult to figure the reasons behind this, because Rajnikanth, despite his larger-than-life roles, is the most accessible superstar in India. A common man can identify with Rajnikanth\u2019s public avatar \u2013 bald pate, the odd grey stubble and an ability to laugh at himself. When a spate of Rajnikanth-jokes did the rounds after his last release Endhiran , he said: \u201cHow they create such jokes! I admire their intelligence, I am simply amazed.\u201d\nHis movies make enormous money and in that rare instance when they don\u2019t, like it happened with Baba , he reimburses aggrieved distributors. Rajnikanth has many layers to his persona that is often obfuscated by what he does on screen. He takes off to the Himalayas once a year, makes impromptu trips to Bangalore to meet his old friends who know him as Shivaji Rao Gaikwad and rides his own train on a circular railway track designed around his Kelambakkam farmhouse in Chennai.\nA long time ago during a conversation with the late G. Venkateswaran, renowned producer and Mani Ratnam\u2019s brother, Rajnikanth described life thus: \u201c Izhutha moochu, vitta pochu .\u201d A rough translation would be \u201cwhen you take it in, it is breath, if you let that go, you are gone.\u201d\nYet it is a travesty that India\u2019s biggest star has become a prisoner of his image. It is a fact that beneath the screen presence and style that Rajnikanth exudes, resides a natural actor, who was last seen in movies like Maniratnam\u2019s Thalapathi or J. Mahendran\u2019s Mullum Malarum . The loss is a direct corollary of the box-office burden that we have invested him with, but meanwhile it is time to say, \u201cHappy birthday Thalaiva!\u201d\nK.C.

Right? Wrong. She clearly tells me over phone: \u201cEven actors have to pay bills, EMIs and house rents. So, I look at the quality of the script and my pockets, whichever one wins the race, wins the race.\u201d\n\u201cMy lookout is not what other people write or produce, but what I bring to my role,\u201d says Mona, who worked as chief assistant director for Mr. India and has performed with theatre groups such as Ekjut, Ansh, Fottsbarn Theatre Company in France and the Ton Und Kirshen Theatre Company in Germany.\nMona recently performed late Chetan Datar\u2019s play Ek Madhav Baug at Atta Galatta and Jaaga. Written from the perspective of a mother who tries to come to terms with her son being gay, Ek Madhav Baug is powerful not only for the sensitive portrayal of homosexuality, but also the touching depiction of a mother-son relationship. The script was enhanced by Mona\u2019s depiction of the characters.\nMona has been performing the play for three years at venues ranging from schools to cultural centres, mainly in Mumbai. When asked how she relates to the script, Mona says that it is impossible to describe the experience in words. \u201cI doubt any artiste will be able to explain how he engages with their work.\u201d\nThe responses that she has received have been both moving and disturbing. \u201cThere were many who found the courage to tell their stories. At one performance, a mother who couldn\u2019t accept her daughter\u2019s sexuality, stood up at the end of the play and said she was proud of her child.\u201d There were instances, though, when Mona met with resistance, some of which happened in well-known schools.\nMona says that the plot is a human story that will resonate with anyone who has been discriminated against. \u201cIt espouses equality, of allowing people to be what they want to be, and not judging them.\u201d Is she, then, against categorising people into definite groups? \u201cNo, I am not,\u201d she says and continues, \u201cCategorising is important for identification. I am sure a girl would want to be called a girl and a boy, a boy. The LGBT community is proud of their identity. I only have a problem with considering one group lesser than others.\u201d\nArt, Mona says, creates social awareness. \u201cArtists have aesthetically articulated issues. Theatre has pioneered social awareness and change. I am very happy to see so much passion for the performing arts despite there being hardly any funding for it.\u201d\nSRAVASTI DATTA\n"

But as 2012 turns its back to us, we begin to review what it offered us and wonder whether the newcomer has anything better in store. And we are reminded yet again that not everything new is meant to be welcomed, and not everything old, to be spurned.\nOld habits die hard. When I utter this truism the only example that sticks in my brain like putrid meat (and well may you say \u201cyuck\u201d) is our persistent garbage problem. If every household broke its habit and stopped finding a million excuses to not segregate at source, there would be no need to dump trash under the metro tracks (heard of that bright idea?) or scout for neighbourhood plots or village grounds. So hardwired are we that the slightest change in routine throws us off kilter. Our minds and bodies move automatically on well-worn pathways. If you were suddenly forced to park your car in a different slot in the office lot from today, I can predict which spot you would occupy first thing tomorrow.\nOld beliefs are hard to discard, and old age hard to accept \u2014 although I, for one, have always peacefully surrendered to the advancing years. Come to think of it, neither the old nor the new need be swallowed whole. We could easily tweak them: customs, mores, trends, traditions... or the names of streets in this city. I find it okay to retain colonial names as long as they\u2019re not those of tyrants, but if you feel that they carry the resonance of slavery, an alternative would be to spell them the way they\u2019re pronounced. In my hometown, a canal named after a Connolly has always been referred to as Kanoli, so one may as well write it thus. I once saw a local signboard that turned a very Scottish Krumbiegel into a very Tamil-sounding Karumbigal. If Lavelle can be Lovely, let\u2019s change Campbell to Kambli. Go with the flow.\nGo with the flow? I\u2019m a fine one to talk when I\u2019m such a stick-in-the-mud on so many matters \u2014 technology, for instance, or the latest consumer products. My scepticism about what\u2019s \u2018in\u2019 extends even to the multiplex, but I should hasten to reword that statement in the past tense. After years of swearing by the old single-screen theatres, all it took for our \u201cwe\u2019ll watch them on cable\u201d resolve to melt was a new, four-screen multiplex just a seven-minute walk from home. I allowed myself to be patted down, listlessly surveyed the bland environment, cast a glassy eye over the overpriced popcorn, and noticed that a video display unit had taken the place of stills (from \u201cComing Attraction\u201d or current movie) stuck on green or maroon baize with drawing pins. Well, at least the loos here were better than in the old cinemas where most doors had locks missing. \u201cGet used to it,\u201d I said to myself. \u201cThere\u2019s no going back.\u201d\nEven as we try our best to adapt to new ways, we occasionally receive powerful signals that the old ways are very much alive. One weekend, around 20 of us waited outside a government institution for an auditorium to be opened. It had been booked for a discussion from 4 p.m. on. Security guards did lounge and loiter, in and outside the building, but the door to the audi, alas, was locked and barred. A \u2018boy\u2019 was in charge of the key, but no one appeared to know where he was. Calls had to be made to the director of the institution, who was on leave, and then to the deputy director, who sent instructions to the in-charge, who began to issue a series of vague pronouncements. From time to time we were informed that the boy may or may not appear at some unspecified time after perhaps having gone out for tea or for some other unspecified purpose.\nWe sauntered to a nearby stall and had tea and snacks. It was 4.45 p.m. The boy was expected to be expected in 15 minutes. Having had enough, we decided to start the proceedings on the partially covered terrace. But by then a smart cookie in our group had gained the confidence of one of the watchmen, who revealed that the boy was moonlighting as an autodriver! We all agreed that the poor chap was entitled to supplement his doubtless-measly pay. The discussion began, and we successfully made our voices heard on the terrace despite the roar of weekend traffic. Fifteen minutes later, the in-charge beckoned us downstairs. We finally laid eyes on the elusive boy, who was a man, pushing 40, dressed in the khaki autodriver\u2019s uniform and nodding vigorously at us as he held the audi door open with an eager, bashful smile.\nI began to wonder whether this employee\u2019s only job was to safeguard the key to a single door. That\u2019s the old way, the government way of providing employment for the masses. The new way would be to slash five employees to one. Which d\u2019you prefer, old or new? My vote goes to a combination of the two.\n\n(Send your feedback to ckmeena@gmail.com)\n"

In terms of durability, we don\u2019t think you should face any long-term problems because this engine is derived from the same 1.3 Multijet diesel that powers the Swift and Ritz that you have used in the past. However, you should adhere to the car\u2019s maintenance schedule, which is very important for a diesel motor and you should also try and use good quality diesel.\n\nI plan to buy a diesel hatch in the Rs. 6 lakh to Rs. 7 lakh price range. My priorities are fuel efficiency and low maintenance costs. My monthly running is 250km.\n\nFreejo\nMarutis are the best when it comes to overall cost of maintenance and they are quite fuel efficient too. We suggest you look at the Swift petrol, which will serve you well and fits the price range mentioned by you. It is a reliable and fun-to-drive. Since you are only driving 250km a month, it\u2019s best not to buy a diesel and instead go for the petrol Swift.\n"

            "body": "Years have caught up, but not much has changed with Gulzar. His kurta-pyjama of sparkling starchy whiteness, his sonorous voice resonating with emotional restraint, his grace and his proclaimed love for the \u2018common man\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s intact. This remarkable poet-lyricist-filmmaker, who was the star at the Bangalore Literary Festival, was a picture of grace and what was even more striking, apart from his stunning golden mojris, was his undiminished passion for poetry. \u201cSuch festivals are important for writers. It tells us if our writing is still working,\u201d said Gulzar, who read his poems to an audience that was all over the place.\nGulzar, who came into the film industry after a few years as a car mechanic, began his film career with Bimal Roy\u2019s film Bandni . From a very modest beginning, Gulzar went on to be one of the finest lyricists of India \u2013 a writer who wrote about nature, human relationships, and political issues with rare lyricism and poignancy. \u201cMy family didn\u2019t want me to be a writer,\u201d remembers the octogenarian Gulzar. \u201cBack then, every middle class family wanted its children to be well-settled,\u201d and being a writer meant \u201cbeing a burden on his brothers,\u201d as his father said. \u201cI think their concern was justified. It was all so uncertain,\u201d said Gulzar. But Gulzar\u2019s accidental meeting with Bimal Roy went on to be one of his most intense and enduring relationships and Gulzar records this with vivid detail in an essay.\nIf Gulzar\u2019s poetry haunts you with its soft-sad, romantic, surreal and philosophical qualities \u2014 all in a sweep \u2014 as a person Gulzar is no less intense. The sleepless nights that he spent beside the ailing Bimalda\u2019s bed, the roza he kept for Meena Kumari when the actress was ill, and his relationship with R.D. Burman who he says was the \u201canchor of his life\u201d \u2014 his poems cannot help being what they are. In an interview, Gulzar recalling RD, said \u201cI spent so many years with Pancham, we would drum our fingers on the walls, on the dashboards of our cars and on the balustrades on the terrace to get the rhythm and the score for my lyrics right. He was such a restless soul. I miss him.\u201d With a persona that\u2019s so drawn to life, if Gulzar idolises Mirza Ghalib for reasons more than just poetry, it\u2019s no surprise. By his own admission, \u201cGhalib\u2019s poems, his lifestyle, his behaviour everything are a great inspiration. When people carried religion on their shoulders, Ghalib spoke of humanity. He lost seven children and carried a huge sadness within him. Yet, he was known for his sense of humour.\u201d\nGulzar has haunted generations of Indians across the length and breadth of the country, as a lyricist, and a filmmaker.\nMany at the Literary Festival saw him through the great pieces of poetry he wrote for films; but Gulzar wasn\u2019t particularly flattered. \u201cIt somehow always comes back to films,\u201d he quipped light-heartedly, as he read his nazms to an audience that seemed to know them all. \u201cNothing misses his eye,\u201d said Sanjana Roy Choudhury, who moderated Gulzar\u2019s poetry session. \u201cThe richness of his poetry lies in the vivid imagery. His poems on the same subject evoke completely different tones, textures, moods and colours,\u201d she added. Gulzar read two nazms on rain \u2013 one spoke of how rain battered the poor and homeless, and the other celebrated its beauty in evocative splendour (\u201cPaani ko lag jaata hain paanv\u201d). In \u201cMein kuch kuch bhoolta jaata hoon\u201d \u2013 a poem on memory and separation \u2013 Gulzar writes, \u201cIt\u2019s a long time since I soaked in the rain of your voice.\u201d\nThe audience was full of requests, and the most affable Gulzar did take them. In a style and a voice that\u2019s so winning, the poet read \u201cMakaan ki oopri manzil mein ab koi nahin rehta\u201d, \u201cKuch kuch uski baton se mein ab sehmat hoon\u201d and many others to a huge gathering of poetry lovers who got excited with each word. \u201cNazm is not just what the image communicates; scratch and there\u2019s more,\u201d he insisted that the craft of poetry has to be learnt like the basics of music. Making a rather important observation about the rise of literary festivals, Gulzar said, \u201cthe demand for regional cinema is going down, but local literary festivals are on the rise. You cannot suppress local cultures.\u201d\nMany of Gulzar\u2019s poems speak of the pain of Partition (his home in Punjab is now in Pakistan). He read his famous poem, \u201cSubah subah ik khwab ki dastak par darwaza khola, dekha\u2026\u201d, and followed it with \u201ca revised version\u201d of it.\nThe optimist that Gulzar is, and a great believer in democracy, he expressed his immense admiration for the younger brigade of writers \u2014 \u2018they are honest and outspoken\u2019.\nThere was no way Gulzar saab could leave \u2013 a huge queue for autographs, photographs, aspiring poets wanted advice, and some just wanted to stand in his vicinity. Gulzar had space for all, a word for everyone and a smile for even the sundry.\nJust moments ago, Gulzar had recited \u201cAaya tha, mila thaa, chalaa gayaa\u201d.\n"

            "body": "With the SQ5, Audi has pulled off a bit of a revolution. It is the carmaker\u2019s first S-badged SUV and first S-brand diesel. Its 313bhp and 66.2kgm of torque lands it right in the performance diesel arena; the engine under the hood is a twin-turbo diesel V6. The SQ5 is a big power, all-wheel drive, compact SUV. It\u2019s unfortunate this car isn\u2019t coming to India as this performance diesel suits our conditions well \u2014 it has the on-demand torque that we so require in the cut and thrust of traffic and also has the economy and running cost advantage of the cheaper fuel.\nThe SQ5 comes from Audi\u2019s \u2018S\u2019 line of cars which is their performance arm.\nPerformance, as expected, is spine-compressing. Audi claims it will hit 100kph in 5.1 seconds, and the SQ5 does nothing to make you doubt that. Floor the throttle and once past the initial bit of hesitation, it\u2019s one long, relentless surge all the way to its 250kph top speed. On the de-restricted Autobahn outside Munich, the SQ5 was simply stunning in the way it effortlessly breached 200kph, and it even had some reserve once we ran out of bravery at 240kph. Helping it along is the eight-speed torque-converter auto (a DSG can\u2019t take extended assaults from this engine\u2019s 66.2kgm of torque), with the especially long-legged eighth gear that allows fast cruising with minimum fuss.\nThere\u2019s something else that makes the SQ5 fun, and that\u2019s the sound the exhaust makes. When you dial up the \u2018Dynamic\u2019 mode on the Drive Select system, a sound actuator in the exhaust system makes this V6 sound like a V8. It\u2019s why you\u2019ll find yourself constantly pulling away from low speeds in a high gear, just to hear the cultured burble it makes.\nCredit is also due to the mildly massaged engine. This engine feels even smoother than the V6 turbo-diesel currently in the Q5 3.0TDI. The 2,967cc V6 uses twin-turbochargers connected in series via a flap. Also on the menu is the cylinder head cooling, the timing and lift of the intake cam shafts, the pistons, their oil-jet cooling and the piston pins that have been specially designed to take on the extra load. The common-rail system can run at a maximum pressure of 2,000 bar of pressure and injects as many as eight shots of fuel into the cylinders per cycle.\nAs for the way it drives, Audi\u2019s chassis development team has taken 30mm out of the regular Q5\u2019s ride height, stiffened its springs and anti-roll bars and specified new, stiffer fixed-rate dampers. The kinematics of the suspension \u2014 camber, castor and toe angles \u2014 hasn\u2019t been altered from the regular Q5.\nSo, while it remains impressively flat and unflustered through corners. The steering is a bit of a disappointment as well \u2014 it lacks progressiveness in both feedback and consistency. The SQ5, as is with most Audis, is better at straight-line thrills than corner-carving precision. That said, its tremendous grip and body control combined with that ever willing engine and aural excitement will be enough to satisfy most.\nNow, for the bits that are coming to India. Audi has given the Q5 a light mid-life facelift that will be on all Q5s sold in India towards the end of 2012. If you\u2019re wondering what\u2019s different, you need to get your magnifying glass and fine toothcomb out.\nThe changes lie with a grille that now takes Audi\u2019s new hexagonal shape and its detailing that differ depending on what engine is under the hood. The headlights get new daytime running lamps, the bumper is new and the fog lights have chrome ring surrounds. At the rear, the tail-lamps get different LEDs and there\u2019s a new rear diffuser.\nLike the recently facelifted A4, the interiors too get subtle tweaks and improvements to uplift the general feel and finish of the cabin. Audi will also continue to offer the 2.0-litre TDI, the 3.0-litre TDI and the 2.0-litre TFSI petrol with improvements that make them slightly more powerful and smoother.\nSince its launch in 2009, the Q5 has always lived in the shadow of its big brother, the Q7. So the mild facelift and tweaks will give it a tiny but much-needed shot in the arm. But we can\u2019t help think it needs a bit more excitement. So maybe the time is ripe for the SQ5.\nPrice Rs. 60 lakh (est)\n0-100kph 5.1sec*\nTop speed 250kph*\n\nLength 4644mm\nWidth1911mm\nHeight 1624mm\n\nWheelbase 2813mm\nKerb weight 1920kg\n\nEngine 6-cyls in vee,\n2967cc, twin-turbo diesel\nInstallation Front, longitu\ndinal, all-wheel drive\nPower 313bhp at\n3900-4500rpm\nTorque 66.2kgm at 1450-\n2800rpm\n\nGearbox 8-speed auto\n\n\nIts tremendous grip and body control combined with that ever willing engine and aural excitement will be enough to satisfy most\n\n\n"

There are tall columns at the front and rich wooden interiors, high ceilings and cemented floors. The Pioneer Laundry has been around since 1918 and the only thing that has changed is a line that needs to be struck off its board \u2014 no branches.\nC. Santhosh Kumar and his mother C. Subbulakshmi now run the business, which has expanded to Adyar and Anna Nagar as well. \u201cIt was started by my grandfather Radhakrishna Chetty,\u201d says Santhosh, as I enter the blue interiors of the shop. \u201cWhen he passed away, my father C. Vivekananda took over until I joined the business in 1985.\u201d\nThe building that the business rents has been around since the late 1800s and has changed hands many times, between Garratt (a tailoring firm), the Lodge of Perfect Unanimity (of the Freemasons\u2019) and their District Grand Lodge and Kushaldoss Chaturbhujadoss, who rented it out to two of the city\u2019s oldest businesses; Murray and Co. and The Pioneer Laundry.\n\u201cWe had many British customers and VIPs who would give us their clothes,\u201d Santhosh explains while his mother adds, \u201cA lot of these important people who stayed at the Connemara hotel would also regularly use our services.\u201d And at that time, their nearby rival was Spencer and Co.\nSubbulakshmi has been in the business for 40 years and has seen many generations of customers walk through her doors. \u201cI take care of the Anna Salai branch,\u201d she says, and gestures to the portraits of its founders and successors on the walls.\nThe shop is clearly compartmentalised according to the different sections. \u201cWe have about four grounds of space but I can\u2019t be too sure,\u201d says Subbulakshmi, \u201cWe have a showroom space, ironing area and a separate space outside for washing and dry cleaning. A team of seven people work in this office. The surrounding area used to be an open space once and it was much later that the LIC building came up.\u201d\nAlmost at the end of the traffic-stricken Woods Road, opposite Express Avenue is a shop with gleaming teak wood cupboards stacked with rows of pressed and folded clothes. Started in 1929, Officer\u2019s Laundry continues to do what it set about doing all those years ago.\nT.A. Abdullah Basha has been taking care of his father\u2019s business since 1979 and talks of how times have changed in the 83 years that they have been in business. \u201cMy father T. Abdul Jabbar was barely 20 years old when we began this business.\nIt was a small shop on Ellis Road and we functioned there for two or three years before shifting here as Woods Road is a central area. We felt this would be good for the business.\u201d\nOfficer\u2019s Laundry was probably called that because of the number of British officers who were their customers but Abdullah is not so sure. \u201cI think my father just came up with the name,\u201d he shrugs, \u201cBut we\u2019d get a good mix of customers; including English. We\u2019d get large orders of cotton clothes for starching. We no longer get them since we closed our cotton section 25 years ago. We got all our machines from Bombay in those days and my father even imported a few, which we still use.\u201d\nThere is no documented history of this shop but it has seen the city and its landscape change over the years.\n\u201cThere was a tram line running through this road,\u201d says Abdullah, \u201cNow you can see that it\u2019s just the mall opposite us.\nWe have a separate factory in Palavakkam where we do all the laundry. In those days, the work was done manually and we needed about 25 to 30 people to get through our orders. With machines we have just four people doing the same work.\nThis is also our only shop and we\u2019ve never had branches.\u201d\n\n\nPeople still come to us for our personalised service and the relationship\n\n\n\n\nwe maintain with our customers.\n\n\n\n\nC. Subbulakshmi, The Pioneer Laundry\n\n\n\n\nDoulat Ram Keswani is a veteran dry cleaner and is busy examining white shirts as I meet him at the entrance of Excello in Mylapore. He has been in the business since 1952 and has many a story to tell.\n\n\n\n\nKeswani began his career in the iconic Chellaram\u2019s on Mount Road. \u201cIt used to be where Saravana Bhavan is now,\u201d he says, \u201cThey had a large dry cleaning unit called Super Drycleaners, which was around for a long time and was rather popular. My uncle used to work there and I joined to work along with him. A lot of our customers were maharajas, doctors and engineers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1960s, Keswani moved on to begin a Bombay dry cleaning chain that was trying to set shop in Madras. \u201cI was the first to run Band Box in Chennai in the early 1960s,\u201d he says, \u201cWe would get shark skin, rayon and other expensive materials. But nowadays you don\u2019t see them at all. It\u2019s just wool, teri wool, cotton and silks.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAfter Band Box and a couple of other concerns, Keswani began Excello in 1975. The shop now has six branches in the city at Royapettah, Alwarpet, Adyar, Mandaveli, Mylapore and T. Nagar.\n\n\n"

At Skillshare, the teacher acts as a facilitator. There are very few lectures and more actual doing and communicating with fellow learners,\u201d says Karjanapakorm in his TED \u2018Fellows On The Field\u2019 video.\nSkillshare started in April 2011 as an online hub for offline courses. The site offers a platform for people with skills to announce their classes, a payment gateway to ensure easy transfer of funds and discussion forums.\nIt also provides a great opportunity to all those who have the desire to learn something new \u2014 for work or leisure. With a unique philosophy of education designed around passion, real-world skills, community, collaboration and creativity, these online teachers started something of a revolution in learning.\n\nIntensive sessions\n\nIt was only natural that they take a few of their classes online, to be accessible to a global audience. Last August, the site opened a line of hybrid courses. Here is how a hybrid class typically works: The website allows prospective teachers to create profiles and list their classes along with a course overview and syllabus. Students can then browse through these classes on the website and choose to enrol. Payment for paid classes can be made using Paypal. While the technical, intensive, in-person classes can go up to Rs. 20,000, online classes start at Rs. 600. The teacher records classes or lectures and uploads them as Youtube videos, which can be accessed by every student. You could ask what makes Skillshare different from other sites that offer a collection of online tutorials and how-to videos. Skillshare stands apart for making use of Web 2.0\u2019s most ubiquitous feature: social networking. Collaboration is encouraged and students and teachers communicate in a language best described as \u2018Facebook lingo\u2019. Relevant videos and articles can be posted, commented on and \u2018Liked\u2019. Projects can be uploaded for all to see and review and students can also choose to rate or recommend teachers with a simple click.\nTara Mathew, who is currently taking a writing class on Skillshare, says, \u201cWhile the class itself teaches you things that you could get online with a little bit of digging, the best part about the course is that I get to meet people living halfway across the world who are interested in the same things and have them review and comment on my work.\u201d\nAnother feature that has drawn thousands of students to the website is the sheer variety of courses on offer. Enjoy classical music but don\u2019t fully understand it? Take Javor Bracic\u2019s music appreciation classes. Need to make a short video for work or leisure?

            "body": "This is the story of Blackie, our neighbourhood female cat. Like our other neighbourhood cats who come to feed at our ground floor house in Kilpauk, she has been visiting us for the past three years. Every year, she invariably brought one or two kittens with her, and I had the responsibility of getting them adopted. Last January, much to our surprise, she brought six unbelievably cute kittens, having decided apparently, that it would be their home for the next few months at least.\nI knew I had to do something fast, or we would end up with a large number of cats. We started to find homes for most of Blackie\u2019s kittens but were still worried about Blackie getting pregnant again in the near future. Fortunately, a local animal rescuer loaned us a humane trap with which we caught Blackie and took her for animal birth control. A donor paid for the surgery at a private veterinary facility.\nToday, all her kittens have been adopted except for \u2018Puttu\u2019 who has made our compound his home. As for Blackie, she has become healthier without the burden of repeated pregnancies. The message I would like to share is: if anyone has a cat in the neighbourhood that they feed, consider getting them spayed or neutered at the right time. Repeated litters take a toll on their health, and it is difficult to get kittens adopted.\nHowever, if you are doing so, please ensure that you take the cat to a veterinarian who is recommended by other cat lovers. For advice on how to choose a safe, trusted place to spay a cat, emailcattitudetrust@gmail.com\nT. ASHOK\n\n\nThis vaccinated puppy and his siblings are ready for adoption.

We took a house in Papanaickenpalayam for we believed we\u2019d be safe there but the next morning, we found two dead rats in the kitchen and I knew our area was infected too.\nWith a one-year-old child in tow, I relocated to Palakkad. It was an interesting journey back then because the bridge crossing the Noyal was dysfunctional. So, a bus would go down to the river\u2019s bed, drive through patches of stagnant water and climb up on the other side.\nAfter six months, we heard the plague was eradicated and hence returned to Coimbatore, to a new home in Gandhipuram where we stayed for 37 years. While it\u2019s true that the Siruvani water was pure those days, it wasn\u2019t frequent.\nAt four every morning, the women in Gandhipuram would stand by the tap outside their homes to collect water in the one hour that it was supplied. That\u2019s how I began my days, before going to teach in school.\nIn the 40s, there were elementary schools in almost every area because children were compulsorily taught up to Class V. High schools, however, were few and far between. In the English medium, there was Stanes Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School and St. Francis Anglo Indian Girls High School.\nIn the Tamil medium, there was Presentation Convent Girls Higher Secondary School, and Government Training School. For boys, there was the PSG Sarvajana Higher Secondary School, St Michael's Higher Secondary School, Union High School and City Municipal High School. There was also an R.S. Puram Municipal Boys High School where my teaching career in Coimbatore began.\nIt wasn\u2019t easy teaching a classroom full of big boys. The windows in my room extended from floor to ceiling and in the middle of class, some boys would jump out!\nAs I was a class teacher, every day began with the roll call. There was once a boy named Bhimaiya who was absent for an entire week and every time I called out his name, the other boys would say he\u2019d gone for a family wedding. Finally, when he came back, I asked him how the wedding went and whose it was. I\u2019ll never forget my shock, and the class\u2019 laughter, when Bhimaiya said it was his wedding!\nEven though it was a boys\u2019 school, the A division was always reserved for girls in the corporation schools. Within a few months, in 1946, the A divisions of all classes were transferred into a new school exclusively for girls \u2014 R.S. Puram Girls High School.\n\nNew beginnings\n\nI was transferred too, and I taught English and Social Studies there for fourth, fifth and sixth forms till 1962. English was a difficult subject for the children, mainly because they didn\u2019t speak it. So we began literary associations and elocution competitions but more often than not, the children would learn a piece by-heart and recite it. That\u2019s when we opened a reading table with the Illustrated Weekly and The Hindu , which the children had to read every day and talk about, even if it was just two ungrammatical sentences.\nIn 1962, three new girls high schools were begun, one of them in Ranganathapuram and I was transferred there as headmistress.\n\nChallenges\n\nRunning a girls school brought with it a different set of challenges. Love letters would frequently arrive. Once, a girl attended the morning session, bunked the afternoon classes and disappeared for days after that. Her father filed an FIR and I had to appear in court with the attendance records to prove her date of birth. Turns out she had run away with a boy. She later returned to school and went on to become a teacher herself.\nIt was also in this school that we once had five girls from Palakkad who\u2019d moved into Coimbatore and couldn\u2019t find admission in any school because they didn\u2019t know Tamil. We wrote to the Senior Inspectors for permission to admit these girls and for three months, our teachers taught them Tamil, until the permits finally arrived for them to officially join school.\nRanganathapuram Girls High School began with just one division in each class, but by my retirement in 1976, we had four divisions each. This year, it celebrates its golden jubilee.\nIn my final year, we received orders to convert one division to English medium. Later, the numbers in that class would extend much beyond the ideal 45 students because many parents wanted their children to study in English.\nIt was that year too that Class XII was introduced and teachers had to become postgraduates in order to teach these students.\nIt was for my service at Ranganathapuram that I received the State Award for Teachers from the Governor in 1972. After retirement I continued to teach economically backward students English grammar at my home and today, I teach my great-grand children.\nAs told toESTHER ELIAS\n\n\nI REMEMBER\n\n\n\n\nAt a railway station, I was once caught up in a large crowd waiting to welcome a senior government official with garlands and banners.\n\n\n\n\nThe man stepped out, looked at me and said, \u201cYour \u2018Daffodils\u2019 are still ringing in my ears ma\u2019am!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWe opened a reading table with the Illustrated Weekly and The Hindu , which the children had to read every day and talk about, even if it was two ungrammatical sentences\n\n\n\n\nN. SUBHADRA Born in 1917, she completed her degree from St Agnes College in Mangalore from 1933-37. She did her teacher\u2019s training in 1939 at Lady Willingdon College, Chennai. From 1945 to 1962 she taught English first at R.S. Puram Boys High School and then at R.S. Puram Girls High School. From 1962 to 1976, she served as Headmistress of Ranganathapuram Girls High School. In 1972 she was awarded the State award for teachers from the Governor. At 95, she spends her days in prayer, reading the paper and teaching her great-grand children.\n\n\n"

Peelers, garlic choppers, cake cutters\u2026knives, oven mitts and oh so many cool kitchen stuff.

Oh no. \u201cA girl can never have too many shoes!!!\u201d is the tag line of Smittens that displays some sassy footwear.

Kollage Kurry has quite a crowd in front of it as it displays hair accessories for every occasion - funky, trendy, traditional, pretty or just wild, is how you would describe them. Indian textiles have their presence, such as one from Rajkot that has exquisite bandhini dupattas in deep reds and blacks, fuschia, turquoise, emerald and other gorgeous shades. They are in cotton and quite expensive. Patola fabrics in the form of dupattas and shawls are also available.\nApart from cottons and silks, swirly, floaty georgettes and chiffons seem to be in style as many of the exhibitors have brought unstitched anarkalis and lehengas in these fabrics with beautifully worked dupattas. Gota work, sequins, embroidery \u2026 there is plenty of choice available. One stall has ready made saris that you just slip on! An adorable range of party frocks for kids from ambrosia, big brands at Burgundy, bed linen and decorative silverware and home d\u00e9cor articles, handbags in all shapes and sizes\u2026Organza has plenty to keep you busy.\nSo what is new this time? Nawal Gani is. She is a coffee reader. Which means you enjoy a cup of coffee and when you are done, she reads the dregs in your cup and tells you your fortune. And it seems like there are many in Coimbatore anxious to know what the future holds for them as even as the exhibition opened, there was a crowd outside waiting to meet her.\nOrganza is on at The Residency Ballroom today between 10.30 a.m and 8 p.m.\nPANKAJA SRINIVASAN\n"

            "body": "When a colleague reverentially said, \u201cI will finish my leave and get back to work on Thalaivar\u2019s birthday,\u201d the reference is accepted without murmur. Because if you are even faintly acquainted with Tamil films, \u2018Thalaivar\u2019 (leader) can only mean one man: Rajnikanth. And just like the old feint of fingers and a cigarette sailing into his lips, Rajnikanth\u2019s 62nd birthday too comes with its sense of mystique on 12-12-12, a date that many expectant women are hoping to nail in while their numerology-besotted husbands nervously pace outside the labour room.\nThe Rajnikanth-phenomenon has long been accepted in South India, while north of the Vindhyas, there has been a gradual warming up over the last few years, though television anchors often fail to fathom the hysteria his movies unleash. \u201cOh he has always been big here just that you are recognising it now,\u201d said Kamal Haasan once when asked by an entertainment correspondent from a Delhi studio. Kamal Haasan, Rajnikanth\u2019s celluloid rival but a friend in real-life as they both trace their early days to the guidance of iconic director K. Balachander, was just stating a fact.\nTo fathom the delirium that grips his fans, head to a theatre that plays a Rajnikanth movie. Coins, flower, and tickets are flung in the air and at times camphor is lit when the opening credits roll in. And once he appears on screen, with a half-smile and mouths a punch-dialogue, just cover your ears as the guy next to you will launch into a guttural scream. It is not difficult to figure out the reasons behind this because Rajnikanth, despite his larger-than-life roles, is the most accessible superstar in India. A common man can identify with Rajnikanth\u2019s public avatar \u2013 bald pate, the odd grey stubble and an ability to laugh at himself. When a spate of Rajnikanth-jokes did the rounds after his last release Endhiran , he said: \u201cHow they create such jokes! I admire their intelligence, I am simply amazed.\u201d There was no rancour and all that lingered was his sense of wonder.\nHis movies make enormous money and in that rare instance when they don\u2019t, like it happened with Baba , he reimburses aggrieved distributors. Rajnikanth has many layers to his persona that is often obfuscated by what he does on screen.\nHe takes off to the Himalayas once a year, makes impromptu trips to Bangalore to meet his old friends who know him as Shivaji Rao Gaikwad, loves his streaks of solitude, rides his own train on a circular railway track designed around his Kelambakkam farmhouse in Chennai, and at times spouts philosophy.\nA long time back during a conversation with the late G. Venkateswaran, renowned producer and Maniratnam\u2019s brother, Rajnikanth described life thus: \u201cIzhutha moochu, vitta pochu.\u201d A rough translation would be \u201cwhen you take it in, it is breath, if you let that go, you are gone\u201d though it doesn\u2019t have the same impact like it does in Tamil.\nYet it is a travesty that India\u2019s biggest star has become a prisoner of his image. It is a fact that beneath the screen presence and style that Rajnikanth exudes, resides a natural actor, who was last seen in movies like Maniratnam\u2019s Thalapathi or J. Mahendran\u2019s Mullum Malarum . The loss is a direct corollary of the box-office burden that we have invested him with, but meanwhile it is time to say, \u201cHappy birthday Thalaiva.\u201d\nK.C.

At that point, we didn\u2019t even know who the other 11 filmmakers would be,\u201d says Asmit.\nA contest was announced and 11 filmmakers from different parts of the country were chosen by Anurag Kashyap, Sudhir Mishra and Chakri Tholeti. \u201cAnurag Kashyap worked out the basic plot. The selected filmmakers were given 10 days to submit two scripts each. I had four days to select the 11 scripts. The filmmakers then had 20 days for production and 10 for postproduction. The 11 filmmakers were not in touch with each other and I was the point of contact for all of them. We managed to pull through,\u201d says Asmit.\nAsmit\u2019s task was to find a common thread connecting the 11 stories. \u201cIt was tough, because each of these 11 filmmakers come from different parts of the country, rooted in different cultural ethos,\u201d says Asmit.\nThe Showhouse team brainstormed on a connecting link between the 12 clues and 12 cities. \u201cWe finally thought of a theatre troupe that travels through these cities,\u201d says Asmit.\n\nThe Last Act has a run time of 2hrs and 20 minutes and is being released across the country as part of PVR Director\u2019s Rare initiative.\n\nThe Last Act is a collaborative feature, comprising 12 short films of 10 minute duration each. Each film is part of a larger story.\nTwelve directors were chosen from 600 entries and given the plot outline worked out by Anurag Kashyap.\nThe cast includes Saurabh Shukla, Asif Basra and Shreyas Pandit along with characters across 12 different short films.\nThe directors: Anurag Goswami, Himanshu Tyagi, Nitin Bhardwaj, Jagannathan Krishnan, Kabir Chowdhry, Nijo Jonson and Rohit R. Gaba, Rohin, Nitye Sood, Varun Chowdhury and Asmit Pathare, Tathagata Singha and Tejas Joshi.\n"

            "body": "With every trip to your beauty parlour, there\u2019s good chance you leave with more than just new hairdo or clean feet and hands. You may have picked up an infection.\nAll of us like to be pampered now and again. But that should not come at a price. Countless men and women end up with skin and hair related problems after visiting a salon.\nHealth issues such as respiratory conditions, headache, stinging eyes and throat from breathing in the fumes of polish, hair chemical and disinfectants can also be cause of concern.\nNo matter how posh and swanky the ambience of a salon, if it does not keep up with the health and safety standards, it can easily become a breeding ground for several viral infections including HIV and Hepatitis B.\nCombs, brushes, make-up sponges and other tools are used on more than one customer.\n\nGerms aplenty\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need an expert to tell me how dangerous these can be in spreading diseases,\u201d says Dr. Veena Sinha, a college professor who still cannot forget the trauma she went through from herpes, a painful viral infection, few years ago. She continues, \u201cI prefer not to go to salon if I can help it. They are a breeding ground of germs.\u201d\nDr. Nanma Nikalji Nambiar, a consultant dermatologist, based in Mumbai, advises clients to be careful when opting for some of the following beauty procedures:\nWaxing: Infection often spreads by hand. The beautician must wear gloves during waxing. A good salon will ensure that the wax pots or heating units are kept clean; if you see sticks in the pot, it is a sign that they are not disposed off regularly.\nEnsure the beautician tests the temperature of the wax before applying; if it is too hot, burns can result or if you can get an allergic reaction to certain ingredients. Any kind of skin irritation must be immediately treated with topical antibiotics.\nManicure/pedicure: Examine the manicure station, pedicure spa, shelves, containers , tools and room before treatment. Many of the tools are non-disposable and if not sanitised properly, can spread germs. The risk is especially high for instruments that come into direct contact with body fluids.\n\u201cThere should be a jar of sanitizer to store the manicure- pedicure tools at the manicure station,\u201d says Dr. Satish Udare, a dermatologist. Infections can range from hair fungal to ringworms or pimples. A blackhead remover if not sanitised properly can spread bacterial infection on the face.\n\u201cIn most beauty salons, the standard of hygiene is not very high. One of the reasons could be that the latest hygiene technology is still expensive and some of the equipment has to be imported. So they skip the expenses and put the client at risk.\n\u201cAnother major cause for concern is getting a piercing done at a salon\u201d, says Divya Seth a homemaker whose five year old daughter got an infection after getting her ears pierced in a friendly neighbourhood salon.\nAccording to Dr. Nanma Nikalji, if you are going in for a facial treatment, poor recognition of skin type can cause pimples or rashes. Dirty salons are happy homes for the staphylococcus bacteria that causes pimples or boils.\nAcne can, sometimes, take months to settle. Contaminated creams when massaged into the skin could result in bacterial infections.\nThe doctor suggests that preferably there should be no direct contact of beautician\u2019s hands with the face. If disposable gloves are not available, politely insists that hands are washed properly. Some of the instruments used need to get sterilised.\nAnti-bacterial cleansers and hand lotions are easily available and are quite effective as they contain substances like ethyl alcohol and triclosam which eliminate bacteria and most germs.\nDermatologists warn about visiting cheap salons. The big trouble area in unhygienic salons are liquid make-up, mascara, lipstick, blushes and make-up sponges.\nWhen going in for hair treatments remember scalp infections or dandruff can be caused by dirty combs and brushes.\nFor men, disposable razor blades should be used to trim their hair so as to avoid Hepatitis B and HIV. Ideally, try to shave at home.\nAll of us want to look good and feel beautiful. So, with a little bit of effort on part of the beautician and the customer, you can look beautiful and remain healthy. After all, the desire for that well groomed look should not lead you doctor\u2019s clinic.\nMOUSHMI KISHORE\n"

The industry urged theatre owners and distributors from across the State to co-operate for the smooth release of the film.\n\u201cWe will not co-operate with the theatrical release of the film if he doesn\u2019t reconsider his decision,\u201d R. Panneerselvam, general secretary of Tamil Nadu Film Exhibitors\u2019 Association, told \nMetroPlus . \u201cThere used to be over 2,600 theatres in 1984. Now, there are only about 1,250 cinema halls because many of them shut down due to the growth of cable and satellite TV. This will wipe out the remaining theatres too,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe other exhibitors are already on board,\u201d Kamal Haasan told The Hindu . \u201cThere is too much at stake and nobody has the right to make spot judgments on the issue before understanding the merits of the case.\u201d On Sunday evening, Kamal Haasan released an audio statement on SoundCloud to dispel these fears, stating that both cinema halls and DTH platforms could supplement each other, and this extra stream of revenue would open up more avenues for small producers and independent filmmakers who are unable to get adequate screens.\n\u201cA single preview show on DTH platforms priced at Rs.1,000 ahead of the release will only help spread the word about how good it is, like a trailer,\u201d filmmaker Bharathiraja said, speaking on behalf of the Producers\u2019 Council. Producer-director A. Kothandaraman (KR) said that a film of this scale \u2014 with a Rs. 95-crore budget \u2014 would require other streams of revenue to cover costs, especially since Kamal Haasan is not demanding a Minimum Guarantee.\nTraditionally, producers of big-budget, hyped films resort to making distributors and theatre owners pay an advance amount as \u201cMinimum Guarantee,\u201d a non-refundable amount irrespective of how the film really fares. Minimum Guarantee (MG) amounts are usually huge for the most hyped films and the risks have often driven distributors to bankruptcy in the event of the film bombing. Rarely, have producers voluntarily returned the MG amounts. \u201cMG comes into play only when you are not confident about your product,\u201d says Kamal Haasan. \u201cI have done it too, so I am actually arguing against something I have done in the past. The way it should be is like a farmer taking his produce to the market. If the fruits are good, they will sell.\u201d Defying convention, Kamal Haasan has offered Vishwaroopam to theatre owners on a percentage basis. A move that will cut out the middlemen.\n\nCutting out middlemen\n\n\u201cFilms usually don\u2019t make money because there are too many middlemen who have to recover the MG they paid to acquire the film for their territory from bigger distributors,\u201d says S. Sashikanth, producer, who runs Y Not Studios. \u201cDTH will benefit quality small films more than big films. It will open up the market dynamically. Small films don\u2019t need the grandeur of the theatre.\u201d\nThe president of Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners Association, Abhirami Ramanathan, hadn\u2019t reached an agreement with Kamal Haasan at the time of this issue going to print, and was unavailable for comment.\nSUDHISH KAMATH\n"

            "title": "Job hopping \u2013 preparing for the new reality",
            "body": "The contemporary workplace is witnessing a new breed of dynamic employees with a firm belief that employment diversity will improve credentials, skills and experience, thus positively impacting career advancement. Employees deem that it has become imperative to regularly change jobs and they are confident that it will advance their employment prospects.\nThe Kelly Global Workforce Index 2012 survey \u2018The Autonomous and Empowered Workforce\u2019 conducted by global workforce solutions leader, Kelly Services to examine issues of job mobility and career progression reveals that while 52% of Indian employees feel it is important to change jobs, almost three-fourths of the workforce (73%) is confident that if they were to change jobs, they are in a good bargaining position to secure a similar or even better position. Nearly 1, 70,000 people in 30 countries participated in the survey, including more than 4,000 in India.\nTo further delve into why employees are repeatedly job-hopping, Mr. Navyug Mohnot, CEO, QAI Global highlights, \u201cThe pace and velocity of everything has changed. Everything is fluid and evolving, the economy is opening up and opportunities are plenty. It would be unfair to expect employees to be the only ones in this economy to be not mobile and static.\u201d Mr. Vipul Singh, Vice President and Head of HR, ADP Private Limited says, \u201cEmployees are job-hopping frequently to fulfil their career aspirations in terms of better pay or more growth opportunity. It is especially true in the IT/ITES industry where technological changes happen constantly and one need to be at the top of the game and employees are lured by various offers including stock options and faster career growth.\u201d Mr. Guruvayurappan. P.V, Vice President, HR, Omega Healthcare says, \u201cThe new generation employees want freedom in whatever they do to give their 100%. The moment they see they are under surveillance or get a feeling that they are not enjoying their job, they tend to look for a change.\u201d\nMr. Mohan, CEO, Career Access blames the lure of consultants and aggressive employers who are willing to offer huge or disproportionately high raises. He says, \u201cIn a highly competitive business environment high flyers are always tracked by media, competitors, customers and the recruiter fraternity. It is difficult for most of them to refuse a lucrative offer.\u201d\nAnother reason is the poor outlook for staying put - employees perceive lower chances to advance in their current position. Moreover, the KGWI survey results reveal that only 46% employees in India feel that their current employer is realising the full benefits of their potential!\n\nMaking the right moves\n\nWhile the benefits cannot be ignored, frequent job hopping can entail some disastrous consequences as well. Ms. Rituparna Chakraborty, Vice President, Indian Staffing Federation and Co-Founder and Senior Vice President of TeamLease Services Pvt. Ltd. warns, \u201cRampant job hopping never works in the long run. One needs to spend a reasonable amount of time to master a specific skill or job \u2013 if one moves too often one is really not learning much. Sooner or later the law of gravity shall catch up.\u201d She adds that employees may even soon reach a stage of redundancy, making them unemployable!\nMoreover, hiring managers deem candidates with too many job changes on the resume as unstable, unreliable and lacking in commitment. As Mr. Mohan says, \u201cEmployees\u2019 image takes a beating particularly at mid to senior levels. Even banks and financial institutions while sanctioning high value loans to individuals have started looking at the duration the employees have spent in the current or previous organisations!\u201d\nTherefore, a job switch should never be viewed as a quick way to bigger pay packets. Ms. Juhi Gandhi Siyal, HR Recruitment Manager, CapitalVia Global Research Limited sounds a note of caution, \u201cChanging jobs must be an informed and wise decision and every step taken should be justifiable; it is always crucial to consider factors like growth opportunities and career advancements but there must be a minimum time one spends with a company.\u201d\n\nOperation: attrition control\n\nEmployers have to wake up to the new reality and cannot blindly expect employees to continue to be bound to the organisation for their lifetime. The loss of precious time and resources invested in recruiting and training employees is immense, not to mention the negative effect on employee morale, motivation and performance.\nEmployees are optimistic about their opportunities to progress in new jobs and perceive themselves in high-demand positions. Its crunch time for organisations they need to know how to hold on to talented staff who favour opportunity over loyalty. Apart from the regular retention efforts, Mr. Mohnot stresses the importance of investing in employees with training and development programmes, \u201cPeople are most sensitive to learning and growth nowadays. Regular challenge, developmental opportunities, cordial working environment and other real benefits are essential for talent retention. Regular and focussed training programmes aimed at the workforce are an imperative.\u201d Ms. Chakraborty talks about proactively engaging employees to build a long-lasting association. She says, \u201cA closer connect with the employee is probably the only way. Organisation with robust employee engagement, transparency and communication mechanism, are likely to have lesser attrition than those who do not prioritise these aspects.\u201d She also suggests other alternatives like setting clear and easily understandable goals and targets, a fair and efficient review mechanism and a strong value system which lays emphasis on transparency.\nMr. Singh has a different take that tackles the root cause, \u201cAn alternative to deal with high attrition rates is to focus on hiring right. This is the first and the most crucial step. Organisations need to focus on hiring right and by having the right guy, half the job is done. It is the most common characteristic of organisations with low attrition rates.\u201d\nTo sum up, employees no longer shy away from switching jobs to maximise personal opportunity and career renewal. Concentrated efforts to reduce attrition are the order of the day if employers hope to be able to retain talented staff!\nPayal Chanania\nfaqs@cnkonline.com\n"

            "title": "Character traits for good leadership",
            "body": "Good character makes a good leader. But, delving into character traits for good leadership throws up diverse features like positive attitude, determination, discipline, honesty, integrity, trustworthiness, fairness, humility, courage, creativity, vision, conviction, future-mindedness, emotional intelligence and so on. All of them are important depending on the situation and circumstances.\nLet us take a look at some of the crucial character attributes, beginning with vision. Leaders should have a compelling and realistic vision that they stay invested in. This will enable them to set goals, establish a sense of direction, and create a roadmap for the future in a way that inspires employees to go after it. Mr. Rakesh Singh, VP and GM of Citrix India elaborates, \u201cVision is absolutely crucial because it sets the bar for what the organisation must strive to achieve. Objectives may keep changing along the way, but if you don\u2019t have that big dream, then you don\u2019t know which direction you need to take.\u201d\nA forward-looking and future-minded approach is what helps leaders perceive how their actions will affect the future and filter decisions accordingly.\nThey can envision what will happen, connect it to employees\u2019 hopes and aspirations and communicate the possibilities in the most stimulating manner.\nHonesty, integrity, fairness and humility go hand in hand. Abiding to a set of ethics and principles while being honest, transparent, fair and empathetic inspires trust and respect in the workforce. As ApnaCircle.com, Founder and CEO, Mr. Yogesh Bansal points out, \u201cWith power comes responsibility and one has to be ethical to be entrusted with that responsibility, so having good work ethics is important. An ethical individual not only builds reliability but also encourages others to work principally.\u201d\nA meta-analysis study by Kurt Dirks and Donald Ferrin focuses on the role of trust in leadership. According to their study, trust in leadership is positively correlated with job satisfaction, commitment to the organisation, and negatively related with employees\u2019 intent to quit the organisation.\nMr. Amit Nandkeolyar, Assistant Professor, Organisational Behaviour at Indian School of Business (ISB) adds, \u201cUnless subordinates have trust in the leadership, it is impossible for a leader to be effective. He cannot get anything done by his followers if he does not command trust or is not seen as trustworthy.\u201d A recent survey by Korn-Ferry International, Asia\u2019s leading talent management and leadership development company, on what organisations want from their leaders further reveals that the emphasis is on those who are both ethical and can convey a strong vision of the future.\nHumility empowers leaders to admit mistakes, accept dissent and concede to a better viewpoint. This in turn promotes the open-mindedness to learn new things as well. As Mr. Singh adds, \u201cHonesty builds trust and promotes an apolitical environment, both of which are essential for the smooth running of an organisation. Humility helps you stay on a learning curve forever. It also allows a leader to have an open-mind, which is essential to study the competitive environment more objectively.\nAlso, since the leader often sets the tone of the organisation, humility will have a trickle down effect, which is always good for the organisation.\u201d Mr. Debasis Chatterji, CEO, Netxcell Limited further adds, \u201cHonesty, integrity and humility are the fulcrum of a leadership podium. If a leader does not have these three attributes, it very difficult to perform as expected and he/she will falter under difficult circumstances. The person will then most likely resort to adjustments and compromise and the organisation will suffer.\u201d He further surmises that these three attributes are the building blocks for all other attributes!\nMs. Juhi Mishra, Vice President Human Resources, InterGlobe Technology Quotient too opines on the same note, \u201cA leader is someone who, with his integrity, empowers and motivates his team members to work towards a common objective \u2013 growth and stability. An honest and trustworthy leader is likely to have a team that rely on him and stand by him in a crisis situation.\u201d\nEmotional intelligence is especially crucial for leaders to be able to make rational, mature and informed decisions without rushing or reacting emotionally. It brings the ability to understand and manage one\u2019s own emotions as well as those of others. Emotionally intelligent leaders can exercise self-discipline on their thoughts and actions and express their emotions in constructive ways. Mr. Bansal also suggests, \u201cEmotional intelligence is required when dealing with a team of individuals. An emotionally intelligent leader would not only be able to deal with his emotional swings but also empathise with and control the team\u2019s emotions and motivate them towards a positive goal.\u201d\nFinally, Mr. Nandkeolyar sums up the rising importance of good character in leadership, \u201cA great leader develops shared vision, creates an enabling climate in his team/company, and provides appreciation for the employees.\nThis is especially important during uncertain times when employees are looking for someone to provide a direction. During such times, leaders serve as beacon for their followers!\u201d\nTo sum up, what a leader is makes a huge difference in his leadership performance. It makes him capable, dynamic and places him at the forefront for building excellence in the organisation. Not only will he set a good example but also attract followers who will want to emulate him. Therefore, character does count!\nPayal Chanania\nfaqs@cnkonline.com\n"

            "title": "Rules for social media",
            "body": "Social media is fast becoming an integral part of our daily life. Everyone is using the new online communication tools to create content, participate in online conversations and update statuses \u2013 be it blogs, wikis, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Flikr or YouTube. There is no dearth of online communication platforms, which also have the potential to change the way we work.\nThe growing usage blurs the lines of personal and professional usage, thus what employees say or do on social media can reflect directly on the employer organisation. Ever so often, organisations are sternly censoring staff when someone intentionally or even unintentionally oversteps the line. Most employees are genuinely innocent and confused about what is and is not allowed. They want to do right, but their innocent posts and remarks often get misconstrued, resulting in grave damage and sometimes even liability to the employer. This is because just by identifying your employer on the social platform, employee actions inadvertently create subtle perceptions about the company in the minds of readers and onlookers.\nOrganisations cannot hope to cut out online social media usage entirely. In this scenario, it makes sense for them to formulate clear social media policies and guidelines to educate employees about their online rights and responsibilities. Guiding them on appropriate usage will enable them to make better use of the communication tools without putting the company and its reputation at risk.\nFollowing is a take on some of the important guidelines:\nMany organisations completely prohibit use of social media on company time. But forcing them to stop does not always work as employees try to find loopholes and backdoor entries for say, logging onto their Facebook accounts. In fact, a recent survey reveals that 56% will turn down a job opportunity because that company does not allow them access to social networks during work! Instead, encourage employees to use social platforms in a way that it builds organisational value.\nProhibit employees from posting defamatory or threatening comments, criticising or abusing the company/clients and engaging in discussions about/with the competition.\nClearly forbid them from revealing confidential, classified or proprietary company information on any online platform. Specify other off-limit topics as well.\nThe organisation can restrict employees from using company name or logo to promote something else \u2013 be it an idea, opinion, cause or product. Lay out that management can request modification or even removal of place of employment in such cases.\nTrain them to represent the organisation in an ethical and truthful manner; use better judgment and think before they post anything. As Intel\u2019s policy states, \u201cIf it gives you pause\u2026pause rather than publish!\u201d And if employees are still unsure, advise them to check with the management.\nExplain that if an employee mentions the company name, a disclaimer saying that any opinions expressed are the employee's own and not the company's is mandatory. Something like: \u201cThe postings on this site are my own and don't necessarily represent my company\u2019s positions, strategies, or opinions.\u201d\nOrganisations can even seek to harness the untapped power of social media by training employees to push the company message and strengthen the brand (but in a transparent and honest manner). Social media guidelines should be updated regularly to define \u2018acceptable use\u2019 and communicated to employees in an appropriate manner.\nTo sum up, a judicious and cautious approach is the need of the hour. Setting out a prudent social media policy will shield the organisation from legal risks and liability for employees\u2019 actions as they clearly define what employees can and cannot say about the company. But ensure that the restrictions do not stifle open dialogue; do allow employees to talk to each other and maybe even discuss their work, albeit in a safe manner!\nAbove all, trust employees to do the right thing and specify more of what they can do rather than forbidding a long series of things.\nEmpower them with the freedom of speech. Rest assured that no employee wants to be the person whose Facebook update violated a confidentiality agreement or spoiled a client relationship! Moreover, being a great employer is all that is needed to have employees saying good things about you!\nPayal Chanania\nfaqs@cnkonline.com\n"

            "title": "\u2018Microsoft Office 365 for education\u2019 deployment at AICTE",
            "body": "AICTE will deploy Microsoft Office 365 for education at more than 10,000 technical colleges and institutes throughout India. The cloud deployment will expand students\u2019 access to high-quality technical education and collaboration.\nOffice 365 for education is a hosted communication and collaboration service that offers email, Microsoft Office Web Apps, instant messaging and data storage to more than 7 million students and nearly 500,000 faculty members in AICTE resulting in a total reach of 7.5 million users \u2014 making AICTE Microsoft\u2019s largest cloud customer.\nSpeaking to The Hindu Opportunities, Professor S. S. Mantha, Chairman, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) explained the benefits about cloud computing in the technical education field and to the students in particular. Excerpts:\n\nHow is the current job market for technical education students in the country?\nTechnical Education in this country is on a growth path.\nWith more than 8,500 institutes in the degree sector, more than 3500 in the polytechnic sector, and more than 2.2 million seats at the entry level in the degree stream, 1.2 million in the polytechnic stream, we have one of the largest technical education systems in the world.\nEmployability and employment are two different things.\nWe need to increase the employment opportunities in various disciplines i.e., the employment market potential needs to be enhanced.\nWe have under employment, or our students do not find jobs commensurate with their education.\nThis may be partly due to lack of quality and to a large extent due to lack of employment opportunities.\n\nHow is cloud computing expected to improve the employability prospects for technical education students?\nThe classroom is changing. The world around us is becoming extremely competitive and students and faculty needs are changing, and hence the education system needs to keep pace with these expectations from an education infrastructure point of view as well. Cloud adoption is gravitating colleges and universities as it allows students the opportunities to seamlessly integrate digital lifestyle to support the academic work style.\nMicrosoft cloud platform covering over 11,500 colleges simplifies online collaboration, increases productivity with its ability to participate in online tutorials, collaborate on assignments, interacting with peers and faculty, and helps students build lifelong relationships with their educational institution. This gives them an edge as they enter the competitive job market.\n\nThrough the adoption of Microsoft Office 365 for education, what impact do you foresee in the way AICTE evaluates the quality of technical education in the country?\nTo carry out the charge of evaluating the curriculum and quality of education for all technical institutes across the country, we needed to have consistent and timely communication with these colleges, some of them located in the remotest districts of India. We wanted to deploy a technology system that would provide an efficient platform for students and the institutional framework, and that would foster efficiency and support broader educational reforms.\nOne of the major factors in the decision to choose Microsoft\u2019s cloud services for education was Microsoft\u2019s comprehensive commitment to education across all the company\u2019s products and programmes, as well as the real value of Office 365 offering enterprise class security, the familiar Office user interface and world\u2019s largest and most experienced partner ecosystem. The council was also impressed by Microsoft\u2019s extensive experience in higher education and ability to deploy a system across geographically distributed locations without adding significantly to the institutions\u2019 IT management costs or complexity.\nGetting the world's best technology, which is \u2018Office 365 for education\u2019 in the hands of our students and teachers, is critical to improving educational outcomes and ensuring that students are prepared for the future workplace.\nHaving said all of the above AICTE would also actively engage students, faculty and the IT services professionals to come forward to develop applications that enhance value addition in technical education.\n\nHow is collaboration among the technical education students expected to mature through the adoption of cloud computing?\nWith Office 365 for education, students can engage in real time collaboration through instant messaging or video chats to collaborate on class projects, regardless of where they are working or on what device. They can create documents with Office Web Apps that provide the same features as the desktop version of Microsoft Office, share class notes by synchronising OneNote notebooks, and create digital portfolios.\nAlumni network also plays an important role in building contact and resolving student queries about real life job environment. Office 365 for education also would enable our students to connect with their alumni to share and learn from their experience.\n\nHow do students in remote areas stand to gain given the fact that such regions have minimal access to technology?\nThe country is witnessing increasing internet and PC penetration, mobile penetration is at an all-time high in our country. Add to this a great ICT initiative of MHRD and a national mission to connect all universities and institutions through fibre optics providing more than adequate bandwidth at all times you have a recipe for unlimited growth. Given this as the baseline, cloud technologies will not only support familiarisation but also give a boost to adoption of cloud technologies.\nOffice 365 for education will enable students in such remote locations to access or create documents on the cloud, optimising the requirement of student to PC ratio.\nThese technologies come at no cost and enable maximum reach enabling schools to broad-base education and provide students with progressive technologies in the real sense and get them ready for tomorrow.\n\nHow will cloud computing address the information security and accessibility issues of AICTE?\nMicrosoft has the most comprehensive approach to cloud privacy and security in the industry, and in the past year, Office 365 has added support for the most rigorous global and regional standards, including ISO 27001, SAS70 Type II, EU Safe Harbor, EU Model Clauses, the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and more. AICTE values its customers and hence the thrust on and the need for secure data.\nOffice 365 delivers a broad set of built-in compliance capabilities, highly secure access across platform and devices with premium anti-spam and antivirus technologies making it a true enterprise-class solution. Hence, Office 365 clearly delivers far greater value than other cloud offerings from a security, privacy and reliability stand point.\n\nWhat are the economic benefits of adopting cloud computing?\nInstitutes today are looking to optimise IT infrastructure costs and also manpower costs for managing a fully scaled IT infrastructure for their respective institutes. Cloud technologies help institutes to optimise on their IT budgets due to easy management and facilitation, maximised reach and coverage for students, faculty and alumni. Cloud technologies are easy to manage; hence institutes can look at freeing up IT resources from day to day management of IT and align them on more strategic programmes.\nAlso the real benefit comes in using hybrid technologies to manage them on premise and cloud infrastructure to optimise the spending of money and time for their teams.\nJai Kumar\nfaqs@cnkonline.com\n"

            "title": "Make the most of job fairs",
            "body": "Online job search engines and social networks had almost spelt the death knell for job fairs.\nBut with the recessionary trends under way, the erstwhile ubiquitous job fairs are gaining popularity again.\nThese fairs bring companies offering jobs and candidates vying for the same \u2013 all under one roof. Not only can job hunters meet numerous employers at one go, but also enjoy other free or low-cost services like resume appraisal, career counselling, seminars, etc.\nA job or career fair can open the door to a world of promising job prospects. But most candidates return with nothing but some free pens and t-shirts in tow! Disappointment looms large as there are serpentine queues just for registering to attend.\nThen they are greeted by overcrowded rooms filled with employer booths which again have lengthy lines of eager applicants. Job hunters spend the whole day waiting in queues only to be told to visit the company website and apply for jobs online! Nothing is forthcoming about the job opportunities, corporate culture or candidate fit. Exasperating for sure!\nFollowing are a few tips on how to make a day at a job fair more valuable for you:\n\nHomework: Carefully choose targeted job fairs based on industry, function or companies as they will attract smaller crowds. Peruse the career fair website well in advance and study the participating companies and their job openings.\nThis will help you to shortlist the appropriate queues to stand in based on your ambitions and capabilities! Study the goals, trends and events concerning the companies that you are interested in. If possible, pre-register online with your resume to beat the crowds on the D-day.\nSigning up in advance can also let recruiters know who you are on paper before you meet them face-to-face.\n\nDress the part: Dress in conservative business attire and ensure a professional appearance.\nUpdate your resume and carry several copies with you. Arrive early so that you can contact the recruiters when they are fresh and not overwhelmed, annoyed or tired with the crowds later.\nBeing punctual may even give you a chance to speak to a knowledgeable representative before the crowds start burning the aisles.\n\nRight expectations: Do not expect to spend quality time with recruiters discussing your job application, company fit or career aspirations. Understand that the companies are there to offer information about general career opportunities and very few offer specific details on current openings, let alone spare time to discuss applicant skill sets or needs. It is your chance to understand what companies are looking for and compare various job opportunities, per se.\n\nWorking the room: Once at the career fair another dilemma you face is which companies to approach first? It pays to determine the layout of the fair and then plan your order of interviewing accordingly. Approach your top choices or the most popular companies first.\nEven if you have to wait, try to get the company literature and read them in the queue instead of standing and wasting your time.\n\nMake the right impression: Shake hands, be assertive and introduce yourself to recruiters when you reach the table. Be enthusiastic and interested in the company and their job opportunities. Smile, make eye contact and remain calm to make a positive impression. Be polite and friendly, yet professional.\n\nElevator pitch: Job recruiters spare no more than 2-5 minutes per applicant.\nSome may just hand out lists of open positions or direct you to the corporate website.\nTherefore, it pays to develop a 30-second commercial summarising your skills, strengths, needs and goals. But be prepared to discuss your objectives, accomplishments and industry trends in detail or even give an on-the-spot interview!\nAfter meeting each recruiter, jot down a summary of the conversation, recruiter suggestions, etc. Note down the contact details as well.\n\nNetwork: A job fair is not just about companies and recruiters. It\u2019s a valuable opportunity to hobnob with other job hunters and build contacts for the future. Mingling with the crowd can help you unearth new opportunities as well.\n\nFollow-up: Do not forget to write or email a thank-you letter to each company you meet with highlighting your qualifications, interest in the job and appreciation for their consideration.\nThis will help you to distinguish yourself from the sea of participants in such events. Follow up the letter with a phone call after a few days.\nTherefore, making the right moves will give you a leg up in the battle for jobs. Chances are high that the attending recruiters will remember you, encourage you to apply and maybe even invite you for an interview!\nPayal Chanania\nfaqs@cnkonline.com\n"

            "body": "The sports industry has been on a flourishing trajectory for the past few years.\nProfessional, recreational and leisure sports enjoy tremendous popularity in India with passionate fan following for various sports. Major sporting properties and events are coming to India, marking it as a favoured sports destination. Add to this our growing economy and burgeoning infrastructure, and the potential becomes simply immense.\nThe field of sports education is rapidly expanding, but still relatively unexplored with pretty low awareness. A crucial shortage of trained professionals makes this a very viable career option for the youth of today.\n\nWhat it entails\n\nSports education is a multi-dimensional field encompassing everything from coaching to marketing and talent management to tourism for a broad umbrella of sports like cricket, tennis, football, basketball, golf, skiing, motor sports, water sports, adventure sports, martial arts, track and field etc. Both indoor and outdoor, team and individual, leisure and competitive are included.\nThere\u2019s something for everyone \u2013 be it identifying, grooming and placing sporting talent or working as a sportsperson\u2019s agent in charge of players\u2019 schedules, promotions, public relations and career progression. Athlete\u2019s physical training, coaching, medical checks, therapy and psychological counselling are a separate stream.\nThere are various sports associations that plan, organise, conduct and manage various sporting activities and events \u2013 think IPL, Formula One etc. Back-end jobs for sports events include event promotion, getting sponsorships, ticketing, financials and accounts. Then there is sports management that entails applying business principles to sports with business planning, brand management and operations to develop and manage sports apart from routine administration work, budgeting, finances etc.\nThere is a communications side to it with sports broadcasts, media relations, marketing, advertising and journalism. Sports tourism \u2013 holiday/travel packages (tickets, tours, transportation, etc.) catering to sports enthusiasts who wish to attend/participate in varied sporting events - is flourishing as well.\nStill more options like sports law, contract management, sale of sporting goods, etc. are interesting dimensions too.\n\nGetting there\n\nGiven the low awareness, there are very few dedicated sports education courses in India. Aspirants generally opt for varied physical education, sports science, sports medicine and sports coaching courses. But some institutions have started launching structured sports education, training and management programmes at Bachelors, Masters and even Diploma level. Students gain industry knowledge and comprehensively understand the field with its emerging needs. They gain valuable exposure to sports industry structure, organisation, marketing, finances, economic impact and current trends along with professional management skills.\nOther sporting practices and associated areas include business planning, event management, operations, sponsorship, infrastructure management, promotions, media management, law, physical education, physiology, psychology, etc.\n\nIs it for you?\n\nAspirants should have a love for sports coupled with energy, enthusiasm, commitment and communication skills. Fanatical sports enthusiasts who regret being unable to play competitively can gratify their passion by being associated with the business side of sports! Sports persons and athletes who have given up competitive playing can utilise their valuable expertise in sports management, sports tourism, coaching, physical training, etc.\n\nCareer opportunities\n\nThere is a growing need and crucial shortage of trained professionals in the sports education arena in interesting disciplines like sports marketing, PR and communications, media planning, market research, event marketing and management, ticket and sponsorship, sports broadcasting, celebrity management, merchandising, administration, front office, track and field management, game day operations, etc.\nThere are other job options like sports agent, scout, coach, umpire, referee, selector, sports manager, event manager, stadium manager, sports information director, athletic director, pit crew and so on.\nApart from sports management companies, stadiums, sports federations and specialised sports centres, various high-end clubs, hotels and resorts also offer sports facilities necessitating qualified professionals.\nSome top employers are Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), International Cricket Council (ICC), All India Football Federation, Indian Olympic Association (IOA), Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, Eden Gardens, Wankhede Stadium, ESPN, Star Sports, Globosports, Edusports, IMG Reliance, Tiger Sports Marketing to name a few.\nIt\u2019s an incredibly lucrative field with blossoming opportunities that are rising in popularity.

            "title": "Are women afraid of criticism?",
            "body": "A woman often plays multi-faceted role. Yet her soft and susceptible nature makes her a subject for criticism for the slips that take place at work and home. Women are mocked, taunted, ridiculed and criticised for small issues and labeled as not capable. It could be something personal as being overweight or being clumsy and slow at work!\nMen in general allow such criticism to roll off their backs and do not internalise it. Women on the other hand are sensitive by nature and tend to carry it with them, internalising it and allowing it to gnaw on their peace of mind!\nSometimes a woman takes harmless criticism is personally and attempts to double up their efforts to be on par with their counterparts. The fear of being criticised always lurks in the background ready to surface at the slightest taunt. To overcome this fear, a woman needs to first and foremost learn to do the following:\n\nDifferentiate feedback: Learn to differentiate between the positive and negative feedback. If the criticism is meant for improving or enhancing the quality of your work, learn to accept the criticism and improve yourself in that area. Sometimes the criticism could be personal, uncalled for and out of malice. In such cases, stand up against it and voice your opinion.\n\nConsider the source: Sometimes your manager or boss would criticise you. The anger may be at your action and not at you as a person. Try to understand the point of view of your manager. Analyse if the criticism was meant to motivate you or to undermine you. When not at fault, accept the fact that it is only his/her opinion and behaviour, which cannot be changed.\n\nLearn from the criticism: If you are actually at fault, accept criticism and offer to mend the situation. Accepting criticism and adapting to the required changes is a must to move ahead in career, gracefully.\nAlthough this is a general assumption, there are women who do not let criticism undermine their abilities. So to sum up, drop the fear of criticism and face it instead of running away and indulging in a lot of negative and debilitating self-talk. Speak your mind when you are not at fault and stand on firm ground for a better and happier life!\nRekha Murali\nfaqs@cnkonline.com\n"
